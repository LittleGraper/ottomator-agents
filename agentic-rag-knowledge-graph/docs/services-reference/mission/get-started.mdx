The ArcGIS Mission REST API allows you to interact with  ArcGIS Mission Server programmatically. This means that you can completely manage your server using any framework that can make HTTP requests. 

The API is organized into resources and operations. Resources are entities within  ArcGIS Mission Server that hold some information and a have well-defined state. Operations act on these resources and update their information or state. Resources and operations are hierarchical and have unique universal resource locators (URLs). 

This topic is designed to help you navigate through the APIs as well as be more productive in working with  ArcGIS Mission Server.

##  REST and Administrator Directories

The REST and Administrator Directories, which is installed with each instance of  ArcGIS Mission Server, is a simple HTML interface that allows you to interact with the resources and operations exposed by the REST API. This can be helpful when building scripts for automation or administrative tasks and applications. The REST and Administrator Directories are accessible by navigating to the site URL in a web browser.

##  Getting Started

The hierarchical root of the REST API begins with a well-defined URL called as the site URL. Typically, these are accessible at: 

`https://server:20443/arcgis/rest`

`https://server:20443/arcgis/admin`

Organized hierarchically from the site URL are the various resources and operations that are exposed by the REST API. To access a resource or invoke an operation you must create a request by:

1.  Constructing a URL to the selected resource or operation as defined in the API Reference
2.  Providing the relevant parameters in their specified format
3.  Accessing the URL over the prescribed HTTP method (typically GET or POST)

The API is stateless, which means that the server does not keep track of transactions from one request to the next. Each request must contain all the information necessary for successful processing. The server will process each request and return a well-defined response.
