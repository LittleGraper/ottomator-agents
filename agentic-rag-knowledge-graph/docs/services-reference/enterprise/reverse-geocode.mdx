## Description

The `reverseGeocode`  operation is performed on a [geocode service resource](/geocode-service). The result of this operation is a reverse-geocoded address resource. This resource provides information about all the address fields pertaining to the reverse-geocoded address as well as its exact location.

The `reverseGeocode`  operation determines the address at a particular x,y location. You pass the coordinates of a point location to the geocode service, and the service returns the address or place that is closest to the location.

<Note>

The REST request URL must include HTTPS. Requests with HTTP are not supported.

## New at 10.8

The `preferredLabelValues`  parameter allows simple configuration of output fields returned in a response from the geocode service by specifying which address component values will be included in output fields.

##  Request parameters 

<StyledTable headers={"Parameter,Details"}>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`location` 

(Required)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The point from which to search for the closest address or place. The point can be represented as a simple, comma-separated syntax or as a [JSON point object](/geometry-objects/#point).

The default spatial reference of the comma-separated syntax is the same as the data used to build the locator on which the geocode service is based.

Use JSON formatting to specify another coordinate system for the input location. Specifically, set the spatial reference using its well-known ID (WKID) value. For a list of valid WKID values, see [Using spatial references](/using-spatial-references).

Example

```javascript
//simple syntax (with default WGS84 SR)
location=-117.196,34.056

//JSON (with default WGS84 SR)
location={x: 103.876722, y: 1.3330736}
```

 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`token` 

(Required)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Specifies a token that provides the identity of a user who has the necessary permissions to access the service.

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`outSR` 

(Optional)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The spatial reference of the x,y coordinates returned by a geocode request. This is useful for applications using a map with a spatial reference different than that of the geocode service.

The spatial reference can be specified as either a WKID or as a [JSON spatial reference object](/geometry-objects). If `outSR`  is not specified, the spatial reference of the output locations is the same as that of the service. The default spatial reference of the geocode service is the same as the data used to build the locator on which the geocode service is based.

For a list of valid WKID values, see [Using spatial references](/using-spatial-references).

Example

```javascript
outSR=102100
```

 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`langCode` 

(Optional)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Sets the language in which geocode results are returned. Addresses and places in many countries are available in more than one language; in these cases, the `langCode`  parameter can be used to specify which language to use for results returned by the `findAddressCandidates`  operation. This is useful for ensuring that results are returned in the expected language. For example, a web application can be designed to get the browser language and pass it as the `langCode`  parameter value in a `findAddressCandidates`  request.

See the [table of supported countries](http://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/geocode-coverage.htm) for valid language code values in each country. Full language names cannot be used in the `langCode`  parameter. Only one language code value can be included for the `langCode`  parameter in a `findAddressCandidates`  request.

If the `langCode`  parameter isn't included in a request, or if it is included but there are no matching features with the input language code, the resultant match is returned in the language code of the primary matched component from the input search string. Typically, this is either place-name or street name, depending on the search string.

It is important to note that `langCode`  is limited by the address data sources used to build the locator for the geocode service. This parameter will be ignored when not supported by the data.

Example

```javascript
langCode=fr
```

 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`featureTypes` 

(Optional)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Limits the possible match types returned by the `reverseGeocode`  operation. Valid values are listed in the feature type [hierarchy table](http://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/geocoding-reverse-geocode.htm). Single or multiple values can be included in the request. If a single value is included, the search tolerance for the input feature type is 500 meters. If multiple values are included, the default search distances specified in the feature type hierarchy table are applied.

<Note>

Use `StreetInt`  to return intersection matches. Intersection matches are only returned when `StreetInt`  is included in the request.

</Note>

<Note>

The label for `StreetAddress`  matches includes the house number range for the matching street segment, rather than the interpolated house number value. For example, `reverseGeocode`  with input location -117.196324,34.059217 returns a `StreetAddress`  match with `Match_addr=1001-1199 W Park Ave` . This means that the matching segment has a possible range of house numbers from 1001 to 1199.

</Note>

<Note>

If there are multiple `Subaddress`  features with the same x,y value intersected by a reverse geocode location, the label for a `Subaddress`  candidate includes the range of unit numbers for all subaddress records in the stack. For example, a `reverseGeocode`  with input location 151.073457,-33.916374 returns a `Subaddress`  match with label `28 Hampden Rd, Unit 1-8` . This means there are multiple subaddresses at the location with unit numbers such as Unit 1, Unit 2, and so on, up to Unit 8.

</Note>

<Note>

If more than one value is specified for the parameter, the values must be separated by a comma, with no spaces after the comma.

</Note>

Values: `Subaddress`  \| `PointAddress`  \| `Parcel`  \|`StreetAddress`  \| `StreetInt`  \| `StreetName`  \| `POI`  \| `DistanceMarker`  \| `Locality`  \| `Postal` 

Examples

```javascript
//Single featureTypes value
featureTypes=PointAddress

//mMultiple featureTypes values
featureTypes=PointAddress,StreetAddress
```

 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`locationType` 

(Optional)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Specifies whether the output geometry of `PointAddress`  and `Subaddress`  matches will be the rooftop point or street entrance location. Valid values are `rooftop`  and `street` . The default value is `rooftop` .

Geocode results include one geometry object (the `location`  object) that defines the location of the address, as well as two sets of x,y coordinate values within the attributes object `X/Y`  and `DisplayX/DisplayY` . In most cases, for geocode results with `PointAddress`  or `Subaddress` , the `X/Y`  attribute values describe the coordinates of the address along the street, and the `DisplayX/DisplayY`  values describe the rooftop, or building centroid, coordinates. By default, the geometry returned for geocode results represents the rooftop location of the address (if the rooftop location is available in the source data). This is useful for most spatial analysis and map display purposes. However, for routing scenarios, it may be better to use the street location because the rooftop location of some addresses may be offset from a street by a large distance. For these cases, the `locationType`  parameter can be used to specify that the street entrance geometry should be returned.

It is important to note that `locationType`  is limited by the address data sources used to build the locator for the geocode service. Not all `PointAddress`  and `Subaddress`  features include rooftop and street location coordinates. For some addresses, only a rooftop location is available; for others, only a street location is provided by the data source. In these cases, the `locationType`  parameter may not function as expected. For example, if only rooftop location coordinates are available for an address, the rooftop geometry will be returned for the geocoded address even when `street`  is requested.

<Note>

The `locationType`  parameter only affects the `location`  object in the geocode JSON response. It does not change the `X/Y`  or `DisplayX/DisplayY`  attribute values.

</Note>

Values: `street`  \| `rooftop` 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`preferredLabelValues` 

(Optional)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Allows simple configuration of output fields returned in a response from the geocode service by specifying which address component values will be included in output fields. A single value or a comma-delimited collection of values are supported as input. If the parameter is blank or excluded from a request, default address label formats will be used.

A particular address may have multiple city names associated with it. In the United States for example, all addresses have a ZIP code (postal code) assigned to them. Each ZIP code has one or more associated locality names, which are known as postal cities. There is always one primary postal city value for each ZIP code. ZIP codes typically have no set boundaries, and the primary postal city name for the ZIP code that is assigned to an address may be different than the name of the local city that the address is in.

<Note>

In the context of the `preferredLabelValues`  parameter, the name of the city whose boundary an address is within is referred to as the local city, as opposed to the postal city name assigned to the address's postal code.

</Note>

Additional details:

-    The `preferredLabelValues`  parameter takes a comma-delimited collection of values as input.
-   The parameter values correspond to two groups: a City group and a Street group, indicated by the suffix of the value name. The `postalCity` , `localCity` , and `matchedCity`  values are part of the City group. The `primaryStreet`  and `matchedStreet`  values are part of the Street group.
-   A geocode request can include one City value and one Street value, for example, `preferredLabelValues=primaryStreet,postalCity` .
-   A request can only include one value per group. In other words, a request with `preferredLabelValues=matchedCity,postalCity`  is invalid.

<Note>

 The functionality of the `preferredLabelValues`  parameter is limited by the data sources used to produce the locator on which the geocode service is based. Not all addresses have postal city and local city values assigned to them. Likewise, only certain streets may include primary and alternate names. If the `preferredLabelValues`  parameter is used and the output labels don't correspond to expectations in some cases, it is likely because the expected values aren't included in the source data for the addresses. 

</Note>

<Note>

By default, the postal city name is returned for addresses in the United States. The default street name that is returned is the matched street name. By specifying the `preferredLabelValues`  in the request, you can overwrite the default preferred name that is returned. You can also overwrite the default city or street name by selecting one of the [preferred name options](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/geocoding/additional-tuning-options.htm) from **Locator Properties** on the **Geocoding options** page. Making this change will affect the results returned when the locator is published as a geocode service. If you do not modify the property before publishing the locator, you must include the `preferredLabelValues`  parameter in the request as described [in these examples](http://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/geocoding-reverse-geocode.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_54505B14CE514C479D0373CA5FD06128).

Example:

```javascript
preferredLabelValues=matchedCity,primaryStreet
```

 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`outFields` 

(Optional)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The list of fields to be returned within the `address` object of the `reverseGeocode` JSON response. Descriptions for each of the `reverseGeocode` output fields are available in the [Output fields](http://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/geocoding-service-output.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_42D7D3D0231241E9B656C01438209440) section of this document. The `reverseGeocode` output fields are those for which "Supported request types" = "reverseGeocode" in the table.

The `reverseGeocode` response consists of two objects: `address` and `location`. The `location` object includes the fields that are used for displaying reverse geocode results in a mapping application. The `address` object includes fields which provide details about the address or place returned for the `reverseGeocode` request, such as the full address, city, place name, and others. The `outFields` parameter is only relevant for the `address` object. The `location` object is not affected by it.

By default, all possible output fields are returned in the response. In other words, passing `outFields=` (blank) in the request is functionally the same as passing `outFields=*`.

<Note>

If more than one value is specified for the parameter, the values must be separated by a comma, with no spaces after the comma.

</Note>

Example that returns all output fields

```javascript
outFields=*
```

Example that returns the specified fields only

```javascript
outFields=Match_addr,Addr_type,CountryCode
```

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`returnInputLocation` 

(Optional)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The `returnInputLocation` parameter is a Boolean which can be used to specify which coordinates should be returned in the X and Y output fields within the location object of the JSON response. The default value is `false`.

If `true`, then the coordinates which were included in the `reverseGeocode` request for the `location` parameter are returned in the `X` and `Y` output fields in the `location` object of the JSON response.

If `false`, then the coordinates of the reverse geocoded location are returned in the `X` and `Y` output fields in the `location` object of the JSON response.

<Note>

The `address` object of a `reverseGeocode` JSON response also includes `X` and `Y` output fields. The values returned in these fields always represent the coordinates of the reverse geocoded location. The `address` object is not affected by the `returnInputLocation` parameter. The parameter only affects the values of the `X` and `Y` fields in the `location` object of the response. This is because the `address` object also includes the `InputX` and `InputY` output fields, whose values always represent the coordinates of the input `location` parameter.

</Note>

Example

```javascript
returnInputLocation=true
```

## Reverse geocode details

The purpose of reverse geocoding is to answer the question What's near me? or more specifically, What's near this location? To best answer this question, the `reverseGeocode`  operation returns the most relevant feature near an input location based on a prioritized hierarchy of feature types. With a few exceptions, the same feature types that can be returned by `findAddressCandidates`  can also be returned by `reverseGeocode` . As long as the location is within the extent of the data used to build the locator on which the geocode service is based, a single feature is returned, even if the location is far from any streets or places. If there are no streets near the input location, large area features such as parks, universities, zoos, or airports may be returned. If the location isn't within the boundary of this type of feature, a postal code or administrative area (such as a city) is returned. 

The hierarchy is summarized in the table below, ordered by descending priority. Unless otherwise noted, each feature type is only returned when the distance between the input location and the feature is within the tolerance specified in the Search tolerance column.

<Note>

The label for `StreetAddress`  matches includes the house number range for the matching street segment, rather than the interpolated house number value. For instance, a `reverseGeocode`  with input location -117.196324,34.059217 returns a `StreetAddress`  match with label `1001-1199 W Park Ave` . This means that the matching segment has a possible range of house numbers from 1001 to 1199.

</Note>

<Note>

If there are multiple `Subaddress`  features with the same x,y value intersected by a reverse geocode location, the label for a `Subaddress`  candidate includes the range of unit numbers for all subaddress records in the stack. For example, a `reverseGeocode`  with input location 151.073457,-33.916374 returns a `Subaddress`  match with label `28 Hampden Rd, Unit 1-8` . This means there are multiple subaddresses at the location with unit numbers such as Unit 1, Unit 2, and so on, up to Unit 8.

###  Example input location 6: StreetAddress match returned

In this example, which corresponds to callout 6 in the image above, the input location is within the tolerance of both `StreetInt`  and `StreetAddress`  features. Even though `StreetInt`  has a higher priority than `StreetAddress` , a `StreetAddress`  match is returned. This is because intersection matches are only returned by `reverseGeocode`  if the request includes `StreetInt` . The `featureTypes`  parameter is empty in this case.

## Choose specific output features

Locators built with the [Create Locator](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/geocoding/create-locator.htm) geoprocessing tool are configured to return the most relevant address or place for a given `reverseGeocode`  input location. However, as a developer of an application that uses reverse geocoding, you may want more control over reverse geocode results. For example, you may want users of your application to choose the features that are returned when they reverse geocode a location, or the search tolerances mentioned in the previous table aren't sufficient and you want more distant addresses to be returned. Maybe you want to return `StreetInt`  matches. You can use the `featureTypes`  parameter to satisfy such requirements by refining reverse geocoding results.

You can use the `featureTypes`  parameter to specify one or more match types to be returned by a `reverseGeocode`  request. If one value is included for `featureTypes` , the search tolerance is extended to 500 meters. If the `featureTypes`  parameter includes multiple values, the search tolerances defined in the feature types hierarchy table above are used. Details for the logic used by the `featureTypes`  parameter are described below.

### featureTypes match conditions

-   If `featureTypes`  is blank, the match is based on the default feature type hierarchy and search tolerances defined in the feature type hierarchy table, excluding `StreetInt` . `StreetInt`  matches are only returned if `StreetInt`  is included in the `reverseGeocode`  request.
-   If `featureTypes`  includes a single value, a search tolerance of 500 meters is used and only the input feature type is searched for. 

    -   If the input feature type exists within 500 meters of the input location, a match to that feature is returned.
    -   If there are no matches to the input feature type within 500 meters of the input location, no match is returned for the `reverseGeocode`  request.
-   If `featureTypes`  includes multiple values, the default search tolerances for the input feature types as defined in the feature type hierarchy table are used to determine the match. 

    -   If the input location is within the search tolerance of only one of the input feature types, a match to that feature type is retuned.
    -   If the input location is within the search tolerance of multiple input feature types, a match to the input feature type with the highest priority is returned.
    -   If the input location is not within the search tolerance of any of the input feature types, no match is returned.

### featureTypes example 1: Reverse geocode an intersection

In this example, the `featureTypes`  parameter is used to return a `StreetInt`  match with a `reverseGeocode`  request.

      "latestWkid": 4326
    }
  }
}
```

 

### featureTypes example 2: Multiple input featureTypes values

A typical use case for the `featureTypes`  parameter is to exclude matches to nonaddress features, which can be accomplished by setting `featureTypes`  as `PointAddress`  and `StreetAddress` . In this example, the input location is within the search tolerance of both POI and `PointAddress`  features, but a match to `PointAddress`  is returned because `featureTypes`  is used to exclude the POI match.

<Note>

In this case, if `featureTypes`  is not included in the request, a POI match is returned.
