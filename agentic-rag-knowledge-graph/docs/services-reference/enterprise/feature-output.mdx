All the R aster A nalysis tools create new data. Typically this new data is raster, but in some cases, other types of data such as a feature  output can be created. In those cases the values are returned to you as a URL to a feature service layer.

## URL to a feature service

When you specify the `outputName`  of a task, the output will be a feature service that is hosted in your organization. You set the `outputName`  parameter to a feature service name of your choosing. The default layer name or names within the feature service are determined by the task. The output URL will be the URL to a layer within the service. Similarly, tables will be saved as layers in a feature service.
