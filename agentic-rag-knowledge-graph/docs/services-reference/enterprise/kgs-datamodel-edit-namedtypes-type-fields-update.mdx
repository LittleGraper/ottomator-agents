## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

<GUID_01CB5051_FA79_42A9_8275_EF008F2C3097_GUID_499B73EC_3D4E_46D2_863A_4534FAF79AA3 />

</Note>

The `update`  operation is available for the [fields resource](/kgs-datamodel-edit-namedtypes-type-fields) associated with a named type in a knowledge graph service's data model. With this operation, you can update a field that has already been defined for an entity type or relationship type in the data model. Identify the [type](/kgs-datamodel-edit-namedtypes-type) for which you want to update a field by specifying the type name. Use the data model [query](/kgs-datamodel-query) operation to learn about the item types that are defined in the schema and the fields already defined for that type.

You must have [sufficient privileges to edit content](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/roles.htm) and editing must be enabled for the knowledge graph service for this operation to be successful. You can enable editing for a knowledge graph service in the same way that you [enable it for a hosted feature layer](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/manage-hosted-feature-layers.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_030A9819DFF7498E9DFCDE6030E5FFBA). The knowledge graph service's `strict`  property must not be set to true, which indicates the data model cannot be modified.

##  Requests and responses

This operation can only be performed by sending a Protocolbuffer Binary Format (PBF)-formatted request and receiving a PBF-formatted response. Details of the request and response parameters are provided in the appropriate `.proto`  files.

## PBF request

Create a PBF-formatted request to perform this operation based on the [`UpdateFieldRequest.proto`  file](https://links.esri.com/KGServer_updateFieldRequestProto). 

## PBF response

Create a PBF-formatted response to get feedback from the operation based on the [`UpdateFieldResponse.proto`  file](https://links.esri.com/KGServer_updateFieldResponseProto).
