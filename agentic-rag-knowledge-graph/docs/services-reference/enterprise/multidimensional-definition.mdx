## Overview

Image services support multidimensional data. Information related to variables, dimensions are available in the [Multidimensional Info](/multidimensional-info) resource.

Multidimensional data maybe filtered by the variable names and dimension values. A dimensional definition defines a filter for one variable and one dimension. A multidimensional definiton is an array of dimensional definition objects.

A `multidimensionalDefinition` parameter is supported by the [Query](/query-image-service) operation, and is part of [mosaic rule](/mosaic-rules) objects, which is used by many operations such as, [Export Image](/export-image), [Identify](/identify-image-service), and [Get Samples](/get-samples).

### Dimensional Definition

A dimensional slice can be a single value, such as the temperature at a particular time. The variables that have such dimensions maybe filtered by any of the following:

* Get three slices: 
  ```markdown
  "values": [t1, t2, t3]
  ```
* Get all slices between t1 and t2 (inclusive): "values":[[t1,t2]]
  ```markdown
  "values":[[t1,t2]]
  ```
* Get all slices between t1 and t2 (inclusive) and all slices between t3 and t4 (inclusive):
  ```markdown
  "values":[[t1,t2], [t3,t4]]
  ```

A dimensional slice can be an array of two values that defines lower and upper bound, which is not common. For example, average salinity can be measured between a period of time. The variables that have such dimensions maybe filtered by any of the following:

* Get one slice whose start of measurement is t1 and end of measurement is t2. If nothing meets both conditions, no slice is filtered: 
  ```markdown
  "values": [[t1, t2]]
  ```
* Get all slices whose start of measurement is on or after t1 OR end of measurement is on or before t2:
  ```markdown
  "values": [[t1, t2]],"isSlice":false
  ```

In the example below, `Sanlity` is a variable and `StdZ` (depth) is its dimension, each dimensional slice represent the sanlity at a particular depth. The following example filters out `Sanlity` that has a StdZ of -10, -2, or 0 meters:

  ```markdown
  {
    "variableName": "Salinity",
    "dimensionName": "StdZ",
    "values": [-10,-2,0]
  }
  ```
</Tab>

In the example below, `Sanlity` is a variable and `StdZ` (depth) is its dimension, each dimensional slice represent the sanlity at a particular depth. The following example filters out `Sanlity` that has is between -10 to -5 meters (inclusive) or between -2 to 0 (inclusive) meters:

  ```markdown
  {
    "variableName": "Salinity",
    "dimensionName": "StdZ",
    "values": [[-10,-5],[-2,0]]
  }
  ```

In the example below, `avgSanlity` is a variable and `StdTime` is its dimension, each dimensional slice represent the average sanlity measured over a period of time—defined by two fields: `StdTime` and `StdTime_Max`, specifying a time in Unix format. The following example filters the data using multiple `StdTime` slices: the first slice is average salinity between July 24/2014 6:00 (1406181600000) to 6:10 GMT (1406182200000), the second slice is average salinity between July 24/2014 18:00 (1406224800000) to 18:10 GMT (1406225400000).

  ```markdown
  {
    "variableName": "AvgSalinity",
    "dimensionName": "StdTime",
    "values": [[1406181600000,1406182200000],[1406224800000,1406225400000]]
  }
  ```

In the example below, `avgSanlity` is a variable and `StdTime` is its dimension, each dimensional slice represent the average sanlity measured over a period of time—defined by two fields: `StdTime` and `StdTime_Max`, specifying a time in Unix format. The following example filters the data using multiple `StdTime` ranges: that are either overlap with July 24/2014 6:00 (1406181600000) to 6:10 GMT (1406182200000), or overlap with July 24/2014 18:00 (1406224800000) to 18:10 GMT (1406225400000). 

  ```markdown
  {
    "variableName": "AvgSalinity",
    "dimensionName": "StdZ",
    "values": [[1406181600000,1406182200000],[1406224800000,1406225400000]],
    "isSlice": false
  }

### Multidimensional Definition

A multiple dimensional service can have multiple variables and multiple dimensions. Multiple dimensional defintions are usually used to filter data. A multidimensional definition (multidimensionalDefinition) is an array of dimensional definitions.

Multiple definitions are consolidated by server into one single where clause. The consolidation rule is:

* For the same `variableName` but different `dimensionName`, it uses the `AND` operator to connect to meet all dimension conditions for the same variable.
* For different `variableName`, it uses the `OR` operator to connect any variable that meets their dimension conditions.

The following mosaic rule object contains a multidimensional filter that filters a particular slice of Salinity data by time and z.

```other label=Example
{
  "mosaicMethod": "esriMosaicNorthwest",
  "ascending": true,
  "mosaicOperation": "MT_FIRST",
  "multidimensionalDefinition": [
    {
      "variableName": "Salinity",
      "dimensionName": "StdZ",
      "values": [-10]
     },
     {
      "variableName": "Salinity",
      "dimensionName": "StdTime",
      "values": [1406182200000]
    }
  ]
}
```
