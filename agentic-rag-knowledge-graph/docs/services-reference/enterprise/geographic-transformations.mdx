Raster Analysis tasks that honor the `geographicTransformations` property in their `context` parameter will use the transformation methods when projecting the data for analysis.
Datum transformations are available for projecting spatial data from one geographic coordinate system to another. For a complete list of supported transformations, including WKIDs and WKTs, see [Using spatial references](/using-spatial-references).

Geographic Transformations syntax:

```other
{"geographicTransformations": "WGS_1984_To_NTF_NTv2"}
```

A task will only use transformations appropriate to the projection, ignoring all others.
