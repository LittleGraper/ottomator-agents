## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

<GUID_01CB5051_FA79_42A9_8275_EF008F2C3097_GUID_499B73EC_3D4E_46D2_863A_4534FAF79AA3 />

</Note>

A knowledge graph service is associated with several resources. One resource is a graph, which contains entities and relationships. Another resource is the data model that defines the types of entities and relationships that can be created in the graph.

The administrative knowledge graph service resource maintains a set of operations that manage the state of the service and some aspects of its data model. Operations that query, search, and edit the content graph are not available from the administrative resource.

## Example usage

Most requests made to and responses received from knowledge graph services will involve data encoded using protocol buffers. Protocol buffers are a language-neutral, platform-independent mechanism for serializing structured data that was designed by Google.

Sending a request to a knowledge graph service involves creating an http client in the programming language of your choice, and using it to create and send an http POST request. The POST request will include a protocol buffer defining the operation that will be performed. Similarly, the response will include a protocol buffer containing data returned by the service. The protocol buffers must be encoded and decoded. Protocol buffers are created using a `*.proto`  file. Different requests and responses are associated with different `.proto`  files. For details, refer to the complete [Protocol Buffer Format (PBF) specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/proto3-spec).

The following is a sample request URL for a knowledge graph service named `SupplyChain` :

```javascript
https://machine.domain.com/webadaptor/rest/admin/services/Hosted/SupplyChain/KnowledgeGraphServer?f=json
```

 

## JSON Response syntax

When an JSON request is sent to the knowledge graph service, a JSON response is returned outlining the capabilities of the service. The following example represents the syntax for describing the capabilities of a knowledge graph service.

```json
{
  "capabilities": "<comma-separated list of supported operations>",
  "adminServiceInfo": {
    "database": {
     "datasource": {"name": <graphStoreName>}
    },
    "databaseName": <service name>,
    "systemDB": {
      "datasource": {"name": <graphStoreName>}
    },
    "name": <service name>,
    "type": "KnowledgeGraphServer",
    "status": <service status>
  },
  "supportedQueryFormats": "PBF",
  "allowGeometryUpdates": <boolean>,
  "searchMaxRecordCount": <integer>,
  "serviceCapabilities": {
    "indexCapabilities": {
      "supportsDescendingIndex": <boolean>,
      "supportsUniqueRelationshipConstraint": <boolean>,
      "supportsRelationshipIndex": <boolean>
    },
    "searchCapabilities": {
      "searchTypeFilterCapabilities": [
        "esriTypeEntity", "esriTypeRelationship", "esriTypeBoth"
      ],
      "allowLeadingWildcardQueries": <boolean>
    }
    "geometryCapabilities": {
     "supportsMValues": <boolean>,
     "supportsZValues": <boolean>,
     "supportedGeometryTypes": [
      "Point",
      "MultiPoint",
      "Polyline",
      "Polygon",
      "Envelope"
     ]
    }
  },
  "maxRecordCount": <integer>,
  "description": "<string>",
  "copyrightText": "<string>",
  "units": "esriDecimalDegrees",
  "spatialReference": {"wkid": 4326},
  "currentVersion": <version number>,
  "name": <service name>,
  "dateFieldsTimeReference": {
    "respectsDaylightSaving": <boolean>,
    "timeZone": "UTC"
  },
  "serviceItemId": "<portal item ID>"
}

```
