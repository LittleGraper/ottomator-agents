Raster analysis tasks use feature and raster data as input. The tasks that use features as input include:

-   [Calculate Density](/calculate-density)
-   [Convert Feature to Raster](/convert-feature-to-raster)
-   [Create Viewshed](/create-viewshed)
-   [Interpolate Points](/interpolate-points)
-   [Summarize Raster Within](/summarize-raster-within)

For more information on tools that takes raster data as input see [raster input](/raster-input). 

Features can be input in one of several ways: 

1.  Specify a URL to a feature service layer (or a map service layer that has `query`  as one of its capabilities) along with an optional filter.
2.  Specify a feature collection.

## URL to a feature service

You can give the URL to a [feature service layer](/layer-table) or a [map service layer](/layer-table) that has [query capability](/query-map-service-layer).

The URL syntax is:

```javascript
{
"url": "<url to feature or map service layer>"

"filter": "<attribute query string to select features to process>"
}

```

 

If your layer is on a secure server, you will need to provide a token that allows the analysis service to access your layer.

In addition to supplying the URL, you can supply a filter string for an SQL WHERE clause but without the WHERE statement. For example:

```javascript
{
  "url": "https://services.arcgis.com/f126c8da131543019b05e4bfab6fc6ac/arcgis/rest/services/hospitals/FeatureServer/0",
  "filter": "STATE='CA'"
}
```

 

If no filter is supplied, all features will be analyzed.

## Feature collection

The other option is to send a `featureCollection`  instead of a layer. Filters are supported with feature collections. For more information on feature collections and feature sets, see the Javascript documentation for [featureCollection](DEVSITE/javascript/3/jssamples/fl_featureCollection.html)  and [featureSet](DEVSITE/javascript/3/jsapi/featureset.html) .

Following is an example of feature collection of points with an `Id`  and `Name`  attribute.

```javascript
{
    "layerDefinition": {
        "geometryType": "esriGeometryPoint",
        "fields": [
            {
                "name": "Id",
                "type": "esriFieldTypeOID",
                "alias": "Id"
            },
            {
                "name": "Name",
                "type": "esriFieldTypeString",
                "alias": "Name"
            }
        ]
    },
    "featureSet": {
        "geometryType": "esriGeometryPoint",
        "spatialReference": {
            "wkid": 4326
        },
        "features": [
            {
                "geometry": {
                    "x": -104.44,
                    "y": 34.83
                },
                "attributes": {
                    "Id": 43,
                    "Name": "Feature 1"
                }
            },
            {
                "geometry": {
                    "x": -100.65,
                    "y": 33.69
                },
                "attributes": {
                    "Id": 67,
                    "Name": "Feature 2"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    "filter": "Name = 'Feature 1'"
}
```
