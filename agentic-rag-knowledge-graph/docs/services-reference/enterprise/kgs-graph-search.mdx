## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

<GUID_01CB5051_FA79_42A9_8275_EF008F2C3097_GUID_499B73EC_3D4E_46D2_863A_4534FAF79AA3 />

</Note>

The `search`  operation is performed on a [knowledge graph service's graph resource](/kgs-graph). This operation allows you to search the properties of both entities and relationships in the graph. Any field with the Text data type or the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) data type can have its `searchable`  attribute set to `true`  using the [Update (Fields)](/kgs-datamodel-edit-namedtypes-type-fields-update) operation. A search index is built and maintained automatically on the values for all searchable fields.

##  Requests and responses

This operation can only be performed by sending a PBF-formatted request and receiving a PBF-formatted response. Details of the request and response parameters are provided in the appropriate `.proto`  files.

## PBF Request

Create a PBF-formatted request to perform this operation based on the [`SearchQueryRequest.proto`  file](https://links.esri.com/KGServer_searchQueryRequestProto). 

## PBF Response

Create a PBF-formatted response to get feedback from the operation based on the [`QueryResponse.proto`  file](https://links.esri.com/KGServer_queryResponseProto).
