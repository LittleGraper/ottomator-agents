## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

You must license your ArcGIS Server as an ArcGIS GeoEvent Server in order to use this resource.

</Note>

The `broadcast` endpoint for a stream service provides applications that have administrator privileges the ability to broadcast event data over a stream service. The HTML page for this endpoint allows JSON to be copied and pasted into a window. JSON content can also be uploaded from a file.

From this page, administrators first connect to the stream service. Next, they broadcast the specified messages by uploading them to the service.

Data that is broadcast to this endpoint must be in the same spatial reference as that of the service advertised in the metadata.
