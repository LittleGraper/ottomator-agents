## Description

A relational catalog service represents a connection to a database. Client applications can browse the contents of the catalog by requesting its [entities](/entities).

<Note type={"note"}>

The Relational Catalog Service's public REST API has been retired and is only available for ArcGIS Enterprise 10.5.x and 10.6.x.

</Note>

<Note type={"note"}>

Relational Catalog Services appear on ArcGIS Server sites that have been designated as a Portal for ArcGIS hosting server. They are created when client applications (such as ArcGIS Insights) establish a Relational Database Connection [portal item](DEVSITE/rest/users-groups-and-items/items-and-item-types).

</Note>

<Note type={"note"}>

ArcGIS Insights must be installed to register Relational Data Store Types and create Relational Catalog Services or Relational Database Connections. Please refer to ArcGIS Insights documentation for more information on supported databases, required vendor files, supported data types, and required database privileges.
