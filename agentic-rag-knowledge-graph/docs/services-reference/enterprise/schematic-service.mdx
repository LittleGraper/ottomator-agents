## Description

The `SchematicServer` service exposes the schematic diagrams capability resources. It represents a Schematics service published with ArcGIS Server. The resource provides information about the service itself (name, type) the number of published diagrams and published schematic layers, and the number of published diagram templates. 

Here is an overview of the capabilities supported in the Schematics Server REST API:

-   The SchematicServer service resource supports the [searchDiagrams](/schematic-search-diagrams) operation. It is used to search diagrams in the schematic service by criteria.
-   The [folders](/schematic-folders) resource represents the set of schematic folders in the schematic dataset(s) related to the schematic layers under a published schematic service.
-   The [diagrams](/schematic-diagrams) resource represents all the diagrams related to the schematic layers under a published schematic service.
-   The [Schematic Diagram](/schematic-diagram) resource represents a single diagram under a schematic service.
-   The [map](/schematic-diagram-map) resource is a child resource of a schematic diagram resource. It mimics a map service resource and is used to export a schematic diagram as a map image or perform identify operations on a Schematic Diagram resource.
-   The [export](/schematic-export) operation can be performed on a schematic diagram map resource.
-   The [identify](/schematic-identify) operation can be performed on a schematic diagram map resource.
-   The [templates](/schematic-diagram-templates) resource represents all the schematic diagram templates related to the published schematic diagrams under a schematic service.
-   The [Schematic Diagram Template](/schematic-diagram-template) resource represents a single schematic diagram template under a schematic service.
-   The [deleteDiagram](/delete-diagram), [generateDiagram](/generate-diagram), [queryAssociatedObjects](/query-associated-objects), [queryAssociatedSchematicFeatures](/query-associated-schematic-features), [loadDiagram](/load-diagram), [lockDiagram](/lock-diagram), [saveDiagram](/save-diagram), [unlockDiagram](/unlock-diagram), and [updateDiagram](/update-diagram) operations can be performed on a Schematic Diagram Template resource.
-   The [algorithms](/schematic-algorithms) resource is a child resource of a Schematic Diagram Template resource. It allows to access all the algorithms available for a diagram template.
-   The [Schematic Algorithm](/schematic-algorithm) resource is a single schematic algorithm available for a diagram template.
-   The [apply](/apply) operation can be performed on a schematic algorithm resource.
