## Description

<GUID_352B231F_97FB_4EC7_9BF3_FF3AE8732BFF_GUID_E1846737_750B_49EF_8811_77AEB29A0884 />

The `mcsServiceStatus` operation is used to discover if the map service is ready for use and the cataloging process is complete. When a map service with Maritime Chart Service enabled is started, it will review the contents of the datasets folder. When processing the S-57 or S-63 datasets in this location the Maritime Chart Serviceâ€™s supported operations will be limited. This is when the mcsServiceStatus will be set to cataloging.  

Depending on your implementation, the cataloging state is a way to know if you should allow users to connect to the service. When the datasets folder has been analyzed and the S-57 and S-63 datasets have been processed and senc files created, the `mcsServiceStatus` will be set to ready. This is when all supported operations are ready for use. 

The datasets folder location is set in the Maritime Chart Service configuration properties under datasetsDirectory.

Syntax:

## Example usage

The following is an example of the `mcsServiceStatus` operation. The response is in PJSON format.

```html
https://nsdemo.esri.com/arcgis/rest/services/SampleWorldCities/MapServer/exts/MaritimeChartService/MapServer/mcsServiceStatus?f=pjson 
```



## JSON Response syntax

The following is the syntax of a response:

```json
{ 
 "state": <state>, 
 "pid": <pid>, 
 "description": "<description>" 
} 
```



## JSON Response examples

The following are response examples for `None`, `Cataloging`, and `Ready` states.

### JSON Response example - None state

The following is the syntax of a response for `None`. When in the `None` state, something is wrong with your configuration and it is recommended that you verify your configuration settings under the Maritime Chart Service configuration properties in ArcGIS Server Manager. 

```json
{ 
 "state": 0, 
 "pid": 11936, 
 "description": "None" 
} 
```



### JSON Response example - Cataloging state

The following is the syntax of a response for `Cataloging`. When in the `Cataloging` state, the service is processing the information in the datasets folder. During this time, the following operations are not supported: `Find`, `identifyDatasets` (where `full` is set to `true`), and `queryDatasets`. Many other operations might only return partial results. It is best to limit use when in this state. 

```json
{ 
 "state": 1, 
 "pid": 11936, 
 "description": "Cataloging" 
}
``` 



### JSON Response example - Ready state

The following is the syntax of a response for `Ready`. When in the `Ready` state, the service is done processing the contents of the datasets folder and is ready for use. All supported operations are available. 

```json
{ 
 "state": 2, 
 "pid": 11936, 
 "description": "Ready" 
}
```
