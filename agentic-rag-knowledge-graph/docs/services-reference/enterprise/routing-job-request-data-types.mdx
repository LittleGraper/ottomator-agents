## feature

Inputs with feature data type can be specified using a JSON structure that represents the features.

You can either specify the complete input using json, or you can publish the input as a feature service or map service and specify the URL of the feature service or map service layer as the input.

## table

Inputs with table data type can be specified using a JSON structure that represents the records.

You can either specify the complete input using json, or you can publish the input as a feature service or map service and specify the URL of the table layer within the feature service or map service as the input.

## datetime

Datetime data type is specified as milliseconds since epoch for the date and time. For example, `1451606400000` represents `01/01/2016 00:00:00`.

## date
Date data type is specified as YYYY-MM-DD. For example: 2023-03-15.

## time
Time data type is specified as hh:mm:ss, for example: 14:30:30.

## travel_mode_object

Travel modes are managed in ArcGIS Enterprise and can be configured by the administrator of your organization to better reflect the organization's workflows.

You must specify the JSON object containing the settings for a travel mode supported by your organization. For a list of supported travel modes, run the `GetTravelModes` tool from the Utilities service.

The value for the `travel_mode` parameter should be a JSON object representing travel mode settings. When you use the `GetTravelModes tool` from the [Utilities service](/gettravelmodes-tool), a string representing the travel mode JSON is returned. You need to convert this string to a valid JSON object using your API, and pass the JSON object as the value for the travel_mode parameter.

The response below is returned by the `GetTravelModes` tool.

<Note type={"note"}>

Because the response is quite verbose, the elements in the response are abbreviated for clarity.

</Note>

<CodeBlock language="json" source="./code/routing/data-type/job-request/travel_mode_gtm_response.json" group="json" maxLines={20} expandable/>

From the response above, the following is a string representing the Walking Time travel mode:

<CodeBlock language="json" source="./code/routing/data-type/job-request/travel_mode_walking_time_string.json" group="json" maxLines={1}/>

The value above should be converted to a valid travel mode JSON object and passed as the value for the travel_mode parameter as shown below.

<CodeBlock language="json" source="./code/routing/data-type/job-request/travel_mode_walking_time_json.json" group="json" maxLines={20} expandable/>

<Note type={"note"}>

You can update any of the properties in the travel mode JSON object to suit your requirements. For example, you can update the `impedanceAttributeName` property to use a different impedance attribute, or update `restrictionAttributeNames` to use different restriction attributes.

</Note>

## locate_settings_object

This object is used to specify settings that affect how inputs are located, such as the maximum search distance to use when locating the inputs on the network or the network sources being used for locating.

To restrict locating on a portion of the source, you can specify a where clause for a source. [Learn more about locating inputs](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/networks/locating-analysis-inputs.htm)


The locate settings object is specified as a JSON object. The JSON object allows you to specify a locator JSON for all input feature in the analysis, or you can specify an override for a particular input. The override allows you to have different settings for each analysis input. For example, you can disallow stops to locate on highway ramps and allow point barriers to locate on highway ramps.

The locator JSON object has the following properties:

- `tolerance` and `toleranceUnits`—Control the maximum search distance when locating inputs. If no valid network location is found within this distance, the input features will be considered unlocated. A small search tolerance decreases the likelihood of locating on the wrong street but increases the likelihood of not finding a valid network location. The `toleranceUnits` parameter value can be specified as one of the following values:
  - `esriCentimeters`
  - `esriDecimalDegrees`
  - `esriDecimeters`
  - `esriFeet`
  - `esriInches`
  - `esriIntFeet`
  - `esriIntInches`
  - `esriIntMiles`
  - `esriIntNauticalMiles`
  - `esriIntYards`
  - `esriKilometers`
  - `esriMeters`
  - `esriMiles`
  - `esriMillimeters`
  - `esriNauticalMiles`
  - `esriYards`

- `sources`—Control which network source can be used for locating. For example, you can configure the analysis to locate inputs on streets but not on sidewalks. The list of possible sources on which to locate is specific to the network dataset this service references. Only the sources that are in the sources array are used for locating. You can specify a `where` clause on each source you specified in the sources array to further restrict locating on that source matching certain characteristics using an [SQL expression](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/mapping/navigation/sql-reference-for-elements-used-in-query-expressions.htm). For example, you can configure the analysis to locate inputs only on street features matching certain road classes such as avoiding highway ramps. `sources` is specified as an array of objects, each having the following properties:
  - `name`—The name of the network source feature class that can be used for locating inputs.
  - `where`—An SQL expression on the network source feature class.

- `allowAutoRelocate`—Control whether inputs with existing network location fields can be automatically relocated when solving to ensure valid, routable location fields for the analysis. If the value is `true`, points located on restricted network elements and points affected by barriers will be relocated to the closest routable location. If the value is `false`, network location fields will be used as they are even if the points are unreachable, and this may cause the solve to fail. Even if the value is `false`, inputs with no location fields or incomplete location fields will be located during the solve operation.

The following is the syntax for locating settings using a JSON structure:

<Note type="note" block>

- Line barriers and polygon barriers don't support the `tolerance` and `toleranceUnits` properties.
- Syntax for all the routing services is same, but inputs that can override the default locate settings is dependent on the service. Refer to the service documentation to see what inputs support override default locate settings.

</Note>

## usage_cost_object

The `usage_cost` object is returned as a JSON with the following syntax:

<CodeBlock language="json" source="./code/routing/data-type/job-request/usageCost_syntax.json" group="json" maxLines={20} expandable/>

#### Example for usage_cost

The following shows an example of the usage_cost parameter in which the analysis generated 9 billable objects (represented by numObjects) and 4.5 credits were used by the analysis.

<CodeBlock language="json" source="./code/routing/data-type/job-request/usageCost_example.json" group="json" maxLines={20} expandable/>

## context_object

The [Context](/spatial-reference) object contains the following additional settings that affect task operation:

-   [Extent](/spatial-reference/#extent) (`extent`)—A bounding box that defines the analysis area. Only input features that intersect the bounding box will be analyzed.
-   [Output spatial reference](/spatial-reference/#output-spatial-reference) (`outSR`)—The output features will be projected into the output spatial reference.

<Note type={"note"}>

`processSR`  setting is not supported.

</Note>

## file

Outputs with file data type are returned as a JSON structure with a url field. The value of the url field is a URL to the location of the output file.

By default, these files will no longer be available when directories get cleaned up periodically. To learn more about these directories, and configure the frequency of the cleanup, see [Server directories](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/administer/windows/about-server-directories.htm)
