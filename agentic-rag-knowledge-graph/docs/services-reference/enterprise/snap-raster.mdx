Raster analysis tasks that have the `snapRaster`  property in their `context`  parameter will adjust the extent of output rasters so that they match the cell alignment of the specified snap raster.

Snap Raster syntax:

```other
{"snapRaster": {
  "url": "https://<servername.domain.com>/arcgis/rest/services/<servicename>/ImageServer"}
}
```
