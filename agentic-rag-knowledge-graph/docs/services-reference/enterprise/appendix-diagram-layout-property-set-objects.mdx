It is a number between 30 and 90 degrees that is combined with the `offset_between_branches`  parameter value to compute this position. When the break point angle value is 90 degrees, each branch displays orthogonally (Double).
-   `type_attribute` — The name of the network attribute that will be used to qualify the lines. This network attribute may exist on the utility network line classes. Its values allow lines to be typed. (String).
-   `mainline_values` —The `type_attribute`  values that identify the main lines. When such values exist, they must be the same for any edge that composes the main lines regardless of their related utility network feature classes. In a list of values, each value is separated by a semicolon (;) character (String).
-   `branch_values` —The `type_attribute`  values that identify the branches. In a list of values, each value is separated by a semicolon (;) character (String).
-   `excluded_values` —The `type_attribute`  values that identify the edges that must be excluded from the straight lines, that is, crossovers or ladders. In a list of values, each value is separated by a semicolon (;) character (String).
-   `is_compressing` —Specifies whether the algorithm must compress the graph (Boolean).
-   `compression_ratio` — A number between 0 and 100 that is applied to the length of any edge after subtracting the minimal distance of its length. When `compression_ratio`  is 100, the distance between each detected junction group is equal to the minimal distance (Double).
-   `minimal_distance` —The minimal distance that must be kept between two adjacent groups of neighbor junctions (Double).
-   `alignment_attribute` —The name of the network attribute that will be used to align lines that are split (Double).
-   `length_attribute` —The name of the network attribute from which the algorithm will assess the length of the diagram edges. This length determines the positions of the junctions along the direction. By default, without specifying the `length_attribute`  property, the distances between the connected junctions along the direction are computed based on the current edge length and the length of the shortest edge. When `length_attribute`  is specified, these distances are computed based on the values of this attribute for each edge (String).
