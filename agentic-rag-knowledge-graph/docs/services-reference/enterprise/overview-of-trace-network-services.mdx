The trace network is accessed through a combination of services to support trace network workflows. Several service types are used in addition to extending the feature service to support the trace network. These extension services are enabled on the map service by the capabilities that the service will support.

This diagram presents an architectural overview of how your services interact with geodatabases and ArcGIS Enterprise.

Publishing a trace network dataset enables the Trace Network and Network Diagram services by default:

-   The [Trace Network service](/trace-network-service) performs operations such as trace, validate network topology, and querying network moments.
-   The [Network Diagram service](/network-diagram-service) performs all operations related to diagrams such as creating diagrams and working with layouts.

The [Feature service](/feature-service) has been extended to recognize trace network concepts such as associations and dirty area management.

The [Version Management service](/version-management-service) provides additional capability to work with and manage branch versioned datasets. This extends the feature service to enable operations such as version creation, reconcile, post, and undo and redo of edits.

The [Validation service](/validation-server) provides additional capability to support the evaluation of geodatabase rules.

To view the REST endpoints of these services, use the following URLs:

```json
https://<host>/server/rest/services/<service-name>/MapServer
https://<host>/server/rest/services/<service-name>/FeatureServer
https://<host>/server/rest/services/<service-name>/TraceNetworkServer
https://<host>/server/rest/services/<service-name>/NetworkDiagramServer
https://<host>/server/rest/services/<service-name>/VersionManagementServer
https://<host>/server/rest/services/<service-name>/ValidationServer

```
