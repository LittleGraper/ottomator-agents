All the raster analysis tools create new data. This new data is typically raster data but can also be feature data. These values are returned to you as a URL to an image service layer or a feature service layer.

## URL to a raster service

When you specify the `outputName`  of a task, the output will be an image service that is hosted in your organization. You set the `outputName`  parameter to an image service name of your choosing. The new image service name must be unique and hasn't been used in your organization yet.

Raster output syntax

```javascript
{
"serviceProperties": {"name": "newservicename"}
}

```
