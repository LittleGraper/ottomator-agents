![Find Outliers](../../images/GUID-2FD18406-6333-45B9-8220-E930C1E154B2-web.png)

The `FindOutliers` task analyzes point data (such as crime incidents, traffic accidents, or trees) or field values associated with points or area features (such as the number of people in each census tract or the total sales for retail stores). It finds statistically significant spatial clusters of high values and low values and statistically significant high or low spatial outliers within those clusters. 

The result map layer shows high outliers in red and low outliers in dark blue. Clusters of high values appear pink and clusters of low values appear light blue. Features that are beige are not a statistically significant outlier and not part of a statistically significant cluster; the spatial pattern associated with these features may be the result of random processes and random chance.

## Response
When you submit a request, the service assigns a unique job ID for the transaction.
Syntax:
```javascript
{
"jobId": "<unique job identifier>",
"jobStatus": "<job status>"
}
```
After the initial request is submitted, you can use the job ID to check the status of the job and messages as described in [Check job status](/checking-job-status-1) . Once the job has successfully completed, use the job ID to retrieve the results. To track the status, you can make a request of the following form:
```javascript
http://<analysis url>/FindOutliers/jobs/<jobId>
```
## Analysis results
When the status of the job request is `esriJobSucceded`, you can access the results of the analysis by making a request of the following form:
```javascript
http://<analysis url>/FindOutliers/jobs/<jobId>/results/outlierResultLayer?token=<your token>&f=json
```

      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         The result of the `FindOutliers` task is a feature layer that provides information about statistically significant outlier features.

         If the input analysis layer (`analysisLayer`) contains points and an `analysisField` value is provided, the result will be points. For all other scenarios (polygons or points when no `analysisField` value is provided) the output will be polygons.

         The result layer has the following attributes:
         -   ID field (`FID`)—An integer field with a unique value for every feature.
         -   `AnalysisField` or `Join_Count`—When an `analysisField` value is provided, it will be copied to the result with the same name and properties. When no `analysisField` value is provided, an integer field is created with values reflecting the number of points in each aggregation polygon. If an `aggregationPolygonLayer` value is provided, the polygons are used for aggregation. Otherwise, a fishnet or hexagon polygon mesh is created to overlay the points, and the squares in the fishnet mesh are used as aggregation polygons.
         -   `Hot/Cold Intensity`—A numeric (double) field with standard deviations representing the intensity of spatial clustering.
         -   `Confidence Bin`—A field for symbolizing the results. Values range from -3 to +3 and reflect statistical significance. Use blue to draw values less than zero and red to draw values greater than zero. Use the darkest blue for features equal to -3, medium blue for -2, and light blue for -1. Use the darkest red for features equal to 3, medium red for 2, and the lightest red or pink for 1. A confidence bin value of zero means no statistically significant clustering, and the features should be drawn in white or beige (the color should be neutral to not draw attention).

         Example:
         ```javascript
         {"url":"http://<analysis url>/FindOutliers/jobs/<jobId>/results/outlierResultLayer"}
         ```
         The result has properties for parameter name, data type, and value. The contents of `value` depend on the `outputName` parameter value provided in the initial request.
         -   If an `outputName` value was provided, `value` contains the URL to the feature service layer.
         ```javascript
         {
        "paramName":"outlierResultLayer",
        "dataType":"GPString",
        "value":{"url":"<hosted featureservice layer url>"}
        }
         ```
         -   If no `outputName` value was provided, `value` contains a feature collection.
         ```javascript
         {
         "paramName": "outlierResultLayer",
         "dataType": "GPString",
         "value":{"layerDefinition": {}, "featureSet": {} }
         }
         ```
         See [Feature output ](/feature-output-1) for more information about how the result layer or collection is accessed.

You can create custom reports for your application using these strings. There are four parts in the returned JSON:
         -   `messageCode`—The serial number for each unique message
         -   `message`—Text that may contain parameters (in `${paramsName}` format) that must be replaced by values
         -   `params`—A dictionary of the keys and values to be inserted into `${paramsName}` in the message
         -   `style`—The style used to format the report produced by the Find Outliers tool in Map Viewer.

## Cluster and outlier analysis
The `FindOutliers` task calculates the Anselin Local Moran's I statistic for each feature in a feature layer. The service examines each feature in the context of all features, as well as each feature in the context of its neighboring features. To be a statistically significant outlier, a feature must have a high value or incident count and be surrounded by features with low values or incident counts. To be a statistically significant cluster, a feature must have a high value or incident count and be surrounded by other features with high values or incident counts. The local sum for a feature's neighbors is compared proportionally to the sum of all features, and the feature is also compared to its neighbors. When the local sum is very different from the expected local sum, or the feature's value is very different from the expected value, and when that difference is too large to be the result of random chance, a statistically significant [z-score](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/what-is-a-z-score-what-is-a-p-value.htm) results.

### Potential applications
Applications include crime analysis, epidemiology, voting pattern analysis, economic geography, retail analysis, traffic incident analysis, and demographics. Examples include the following:

-    Where are anomalous spending patterns in Los Angeles? 
-    Where are the sharpest boundaries between affluence and poverty in the study area?
-    Where are there unexpectedly high rates of diabetes across the study area?
-    Are stores struggling or low performing despite being surrounded by high performing stores?
-    Where are there unexpectedly high rates of insurance claims in the greater Phoenix area?
-    Are there counties in the United States with unusually low life expectancy?

### Outlier analysis considerations

Consider the following when undertaking an outlier analysis:

-   What is the analysis field? 

    The Find Outliers analysis tool assesses whether high or low values (the number of crimes, accident severity, or dollars spent on sporting goods, for example) cluster spatially. The field containing those values is the analysis field. When the analysis layer represents incident points and you are only interested in locating high and low incident densities, choose NO ANALYSIS FIELD. When you choose NO ANALYSIS FIELD, the `FindOutliers` task will overlay the incident points with a fishnet or hexagon and count the number of incidents within each fishnet or hexagon cell. The incident count values will then be used as the analysis field.
-   What is the question?

    How you construct the analysis field determines the types of questions that can be answered. Are you most interested in determining where there are lots of incidents or where high and low values for a particular attribute cluster spatially? If so, run the `FindOutliers` task on the raw values or raw incident counts. This type of analysis is particularly helpful for resource allocation types of problems. Alternatively (or in addition), you can locate areas with unexpectedly high values in relation to some other variable. If you are analyzing foreclosures, for example, you may expect more foreclosures in locations with more homes (that is, at some level, you expect the number of foreclosures to be a function of the number of houses). For each analysis layer area, divide the number of foreclosures by the number of homes, and run the `FindOutliers` task on this ratio. For this analysis, you are no longer asking Where are there unusually low foreclosures? You are asking Where are there unexpectedly low numbers of foreclosures, given the number of homes? By creating a rate or ratio prior to analysis, you can control for certain expected relationships (for example, the number of foreclosures is a function of housing stock) and will then be identifying unexpected outlier areas.
-   Does the analysis layer contain at least 30 features? 

    Results aren't reliable with fewer than 30 features.

### Calculations

The Anselin Local Moran's I statistic is calculated for each feature.
