The Dissolve Boundaries task finds polygons that overlap or share a common boundary and merges them together to form a single polygon.

You can control which boundaries are merged by specifying a field. For example, if you have a layer of counties, and each county has a `State_Name` attribute, you can dissolve boundaries using the `State_Name` attribute. Adjacent counties will be merged together if they have the same value for `State_Name`. The end result is a layer of state boundaries.

         (Required)
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         The layer containing polygon features that will be dissolved.

   <StyledTableRow>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         `dissolveFields`
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         One or more fields from the `inputLayer` that control which polygons are merged. If you don't supply `dissolveFields`, or you supply an empty list of fields, polygons that share a common border (that is, they are adjacent) or polygon areas that overlap will be dissolved into one polygon. The result will always include a `Count` field, which represents the number of input features that share the dissolve criteria.

         If you do supply values for the `dissolveFields` parameter, polygons that share a common border and contain the same value in one or more fields will be dissolved. For example, if you have a layer of counties, and each county has a `State_Name` attribute, you can dissolve boundaries using the `State_Name` attribute. Adjacent counties will be merged together if they have the same case-sensitive value for `State_Name`. The end result is a layer of state boundaries. If two or more fields are specified, the values in these fields must be the same for the boundary to be dissolved.

         Example:`"dissolveFields": ["State_Name", "District"]`

   <StyledTableRow>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         `summaryFields`
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         A list of field names and statistical summary type that you wish to calculate from the polygons that are dissolved together. For example, if you are dissolving counties based on `State_Name`, and each county had a `Population` field, you can sum `Population`. The result would be a layer of state boundaries with total population.

         Syntax: `["fieldName summaryType","fieldName summaryType", ...]`

         `fieldName` is one of the numeric or date fields from the `inputLayer` parameter.

         `summaryType` is one of the following:
         -   `Sum`—Calculates the sum for all the input polygons that are dissolved into each output feature. This statistic type is not supported for date fields.
         -   `Mean`—Calculates the average for all the input polygons that are dissolved into each output feature. This statistic type is not supported for date fields.
         -   `Min`—Finds the smallest value for all the input polygons that are dissolved into each output feature. This statistic type is supported for date fields.
         -   `Max`—Finds the largest value for all the input polygons that are dissolved into each output feature. This statistic type is supported for date fields.
         -   `Stddev`—Finds the standard deviation for all the input polygons that are dissolved into each output feature. This statistic type is not supported for date fields.

         Example: `"summaryFields": ["Annual_Sales Sum", "Annual_Sales Min"]`

         Specifies whether multipart features (i.e. features which share a common attribute table but are not visibly connected) are allowed in the output feature class.
         -   Type: Boolean
         -   Values:
              -   `True`: Specifies that multipart features are allowed.
              -   `False`: Specifies that multipart features are not allowed. Instead of creating multipart features, individual features will be created for each part. Any existing multipart features from the `inputLayer` will be returned as single part features in the result.

## Response
When you submit a request, the service assigns a unique job ID for the transaction.

Syntax:
```javascript
{
"jobId": "<unique job identifier>",
"jobStatus": "<job status>"
}
```
After the initial request is submitted you can use the `jobId` to periodically check the status of the job and messages as described in the topic [Check job status](/checking-job-status-1). Once the job has successfully completed, you use the `jobId` to retrive the results. To track the status, you can make a request of the following form:
```javascript
http://<analysis url>/DissolveBoundaries/jobs/<jobId>
```
## Accessing results
When the status of the job request is `esriJobSucceeded`, you can access the results of the analysis by making a request of the following form.
```javascript
http://<analysis url>/DissolveBoundaries/jobs/<jobId>/results/dissolvedLayer?token=<your token>&f=json
```
<StyledTable headers={"Parameter,Description"}>
   <StyledTableRow>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         `dissolvedLayer`
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         The result of dissolving the input polygons.

         Example:
         ```javascript
         {"url": "http://<analysis url>/DissolveBoundaries/jobs/<jobId>/results/dissolvedLayer"}
         ```
         The result has properties for parameter name, data type, and value. The contents of value depends upon the `outputName` parameter provided in the initial request.
         -   If `outputName` was provided, `value` contains the url to the feature service layer.
         ```javascript
         {
        "paramName":"dissolvedLayer",
        "dataType":"GPString",
        "value":{"url":"<hosted featureservice layer url>"}
         }
         ```
         -   If `OutputName` was not provided, `value` contains a feature collection.
         ```javascript
         {
         "paramName":"dissolvedLayer",
         "dataType":"GPString",
         "value":{"layerDefinition": {}, "featureSet": {}  }
         }
         ```
         See [Feature Output ](/feature-output-1) for more information about how the result layer or collection is accessed.
