The Spatial analysis service contains a number of tasks that you can access and use in your applications. These tasks are arranged below into categories; the categories match those that appear in Perform Analysis sidebar in your portal's Map Viewer Classic. The categories are simply logical groupings and do not affect how you access or use the tasks in any way. 

<Note type={"note"}>
Using Spatial analysis service tasks in ArcGIS Online consumes credits. For more information on credits see [Service credits overview](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/credits/overview?rsource=%2Fsoftware%2Farcgis%2Farcgisonline%2Fcredits).

#### Tasks that summarize data
<StyledTable headers={"Tool name,Description"}>
<StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      [Aggregate Points](/sa-aggregate-points)
   </StyledTableCell>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      The Aggregate Points task works with a layer of point features and a layer of polygon features or bins. It first identifies which points fall within each polygon's area. After identifying this point-in-polygon spatial relationship, statistics for all points in the polygon are calculated and assigned to the area. The most basic statistic is the number of points within the polygon (count), but you can get other statistics as well.
   </StyledTableCell>
</StyledTableRow>
<StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      [Join Features](/sa-join-features)
   </StyledTableCell>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      The Join Features task works with two layers and joins the attributes from one feature to another based on spatial and attribute relationships.
   </StyledTableCell>
</StyledTableRow>
<StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      [Summarize Center and Dispersion](/sa-summarize-center-and-dispersion)
   </StyledTableCell>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      The Summarize Center and Dispersion task finds central features and directional distributions.
   </StyledTableCell>
</StyledTableRow>
<StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      [Summarize Within](/sa-summarize-within)
   </StyledTableCell>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      The Summarize Within task finds the point, line, or polygon features (or portions of these features) that are within the boundaries of polygons in another layer.
   </StyledTableCell>
</StyledTableRow>
<StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      [Summarize Nearby](/summarize-nearby)
   </StyledTableCell>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      The Summarize Nearby task finds features that are within a specified distance of features in the input layer. Distance can be measured as a straight-line distance or by a specified travel mode. Statistics are then calculated for the nearby features.
   </StyledTableCell>
</StyledTableRow>
</StyledTable>
#### Tasks that find locations
<StyledTable headers={"Tool name,Description"}>
<StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      [Choose Best Facilities](/choose-best-facilities)
   </StyledTableCell>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      The Choose Best Facilities task finds the set of facilities that will best serve demand from surrounding areas.
      Facilities might be public institutions that offer a service, such as fire stations, schools, or libraries, or they might be commercial ones such as drug stores or distribution centers for a parcel delivery service. Demand represents the need for a service that the facilities can meet. Demand is associated with point locations, with each location representing a given amount of demand.
   </StyledTableCell>
</StyledTableRow>
<StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      [Create Viewshed](/sa-create-viewshed)
   </StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>
<StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

   </StyledTableCell>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      The Create Watersheds task determines the watershed, or upstream contributing area, for each point in your analysis layer. For example, suppose you have point features representing locations of waterborne contamination, and you want to find the likely sources of the contamination. Since the source of the contamination must be somewhere within the watershed upstream of the point, you would use this tool to define the watersheds containing the sources of the contaminant.

      The Derive New Locations task creates new features from the input layers that meet a query you specify. A query is made up of one or more expressions. There are two types of expressions: attribute and spatial. An example of an attribute expression is that a parcel must be vacant, which is an attribute of the Parcels layer (`where STATUS = 'VACANT'`). An example of a spatial expression is that the parcel must also be within a certain distance of a river (`Parcels within a distance of 0.75 Miles from Rivers`).

      <Note type={"note"}>
         The Field Calculator task is no longer supported in ArcGIS Online as of March 2021 or in versions of ArcGIS Enterprise 10.9 or higher.
         [Learn more about how to calculate field values](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/calculate-fields.htm)
      </Note>
      The Field Calculator task updates values in one or more fields based on an expression you provide. The fields to update can be existing fields or a new fields that you create as part of the task request. The expression can use values from other fields. The result of this task is a new layer with all the fields from the input layer as well as any new fields you create. Field values are updated according to the expressions you provide.

      [Overlay Layers](/sa-overlay-layers)
   </StyledTableCell>
   <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      The Overlay Layers task combines two or more layers into a single layer. You can think of overlay as peering through a stack of maps and creating a single map containing all the information from the stack. Before the advent of GIS, cartographers would manually copy maps onto clear acetate sheets, overlay the sheets on a light table, and hand draw a new map from the overlaid data. Overlay is more than a merging of line work; all the attributes of the features in the overlay are carried through to the final product. Overlay is used to answer one of the most basic questions of geography: What is on top of what?
