All standard spatial analysis tasks have input parameters that take features as their input. Features can be input in one of two ways:

1.  Specify a URL to a feature service layer (or a map service layer that has `query` as one of its capabilities) along with an optional filter.
2.  Specify a feature collection.

##  URL to a feature service

You can specify the URL to a [feature service layer](/layer-table) or a [map service layer](/layer-table) that has [query capability](/query-map-service-layer).

URL syntax:

```javascript
{
"url": "<url to feature or map service layer>"
"serviceToken": "<token to allow access to feature service layer>"
"filter": "<attribute query string to select features to process>"
}

```

 

If your layer is on a secure server, you need to provide a token that allows the analysis service to access your layer.

<Note type={"note"}>

You cannot run any of the analysis tasks using data from ArcGIS Server map or feature services that are not publically accessible. That is, the URL to the service must be a public URL, not a URL that is only accessible behind a firewall. If you use a nonpublic map or feature service, you'll receive an error indicating that the URL is not accessible.

</Note>

In addition to supplying the URL, you can supply a filter string for an SQL WHERE clause, but without the WHERE statement. The following is an example:

```javascript
{
  "url": "https://services.arcgis.com/f126c8da131543019b05e4bfab6fc6ac/arcgis/rest/services/hospitals/FeatureServer/0",
  "filter": "STATE='CA'"
}
```

 

If no filter is supplied, all features are available to the analysis service.

## featureCollection

The other option is to send a `featureCollection` instead of a layer. For more information about feature collections and feature sets, see the JavaScript documentation as follows:

-   `featureCollection`: [https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/jssamples/fl_featureCollection.html](DEVSITE/en/javascript/jssamples/fl_featureCollection.html)
-   `featureSet`: [https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/jsapi/featureset.html](DEVSITE/en/javascript/jsapi/featureset.html)

This is an example of a feature collection of points with `Id` and `Name` attributes.

```javascript
{
    "layerDefinition": {
        "geometryType": "esriGeometryPoint",
        "fields": [
            {
                "name": "Id",
                "type": "esriFieldTypeOID",
                "alias": "Id"
            },
            {
                "name": "Name",
                "type": "esriFieldTypeString",
                "alias": "Name"
            }
        ]
    },
    "featureSet": {
        "geometryType": "esriGeometryPoint",
        "spatialReference": {
            "wkid": 4326
        },
        "features": [
            {
                "geometry": {
                    "x": -104.44,
                    "y": 34.83
                },
                "attributes": {
                    "Id": 43,
                    "Name": "Feature 1"
                }
            },
            {
                "geometry": {
                    "x": -100.65,
                    "y": 33.69
                },
                "attributes": {
                    "Id": 67,
                    "Name": "Feature 2"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
