The `context` parameter provides additional options that affect spatial analysis requests. These parameters allow you to control the following:

-   `extent`—The processing extent that determines which features are included in the analysis.
-   `outSR`—The spatial reference of the result.

You can define the processing extent using a different spatial reference than what you set for the output spatial reference. For example, you can define the `extent` property using coordinates in the spatial reference `wkid 4326` (GDC_WGS_1984), but set the spatial reference of the analysis result to be in `wkid 3857` (WGS_1984 Web Mercator - Auxiliary Sphere).

Context syntax:

```javascript
"context": {
  "outSR": {"wkid": 3857}
  "extent": {
    "xmin": -122.68
    "ymin": 45.5
    "xmax": -122.45
    "ymax": 45.6
    "spatialReference": {"wkid": 4326}
  }
```

 

## Extent

Tasks that have the `extent` property in the `context` parameter will only process features that overlap the specified extent. The output features will have an extent that is the same as or larger than the `extent` property, as demonstrated in the following example:

Extent syntax:

```javascript
"extent": {
  "xmin": <minimum x-coordinate>
  "ymin": <minimum y-coordinate>
  "xmax": <maximum x-coordinate>
  "ymax": <maximum y-coordinate>
  "spatialReference": {"wkid": <spatial reference well-known identifier>}
}
```

 

See the [Output spatial reference](/spatial-reference#output-spatial-reference) section below for information about the `spatialReference` property.

Extent example:

```javascript
"extent": {
  "xmin": -122.68,
  "ymin": 45.53,
  "xmax": -122.45,
  "ymax": 45.6,
  "spatialReference": {
    "wkid": 4326
  }
}
```

 

Using the `extent` property is useful when you need to process only a portion of a larger dataset. Any feature that overlaps the rectangle defined by the `extent` property will be processed during analysis. The rectangle is used only to select features, not clip them. The extent of the output dataset will typically be larger than the defined `extent` property to account for features that overlap the `extent` rectangle.

## Output spatial reference

Tasks that have the `outSR` property in the `context` parameter will return features in the specified spatial reference. It is important to choose a spatial reference that's appropriate for your dataset and analysis type.

Spatial reference syntax:

```javascript
"outSR": {"wkid" : <wkid>}
```

 

The `wkid` is the well-known ID of a spatial reference. See [Using spatial references](/using-spatial-references) for supported spatial references and their IDs.

Spatial reference example (GCS_WGS_1984)

```javascript
"outSR": {"wkid": 4326}
```
