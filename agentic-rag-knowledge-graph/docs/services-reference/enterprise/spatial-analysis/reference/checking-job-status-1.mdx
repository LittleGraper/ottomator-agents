Tasks in the Spatial Analysis service run asynchronously, meaning that you submit a request (or job) and then poll the service for status. When you submit a request, the Spatial Analysis service returns a unique job ID for the transaction. You can use the job ID to periodically check the status of the job and messages.

Syntax:

```javascript
http://<analysis url>/arcgis/rest/services/tasks/GPServer/<task name>/jobs/<jobId>
```

 

The job will start with a status of `esriJobSubmitted`. When the job has successfully completed, the job status will change to `esriJobSucceeded` and the `results`resource will be populated. You can append the `paramUrl`value from the `results`resource to the request with the job ID to retrieve the results of the task.

## jobStatus values

The `jobStatus` property can have the following values:

-   `esriJobSubmitted`
-   `esriJobWaiting`
-   `esriJobExecuting`
-   `esriJobSucceeded`
-   `esriJobFailed`
-   `esriJobTimedOut`
-   `esriJobCancelling`
-   `esriJobCancelled`
