-   `false` —If the maximum drop on the inside of an edge cell is greater than zero, the flow direction will be determined as usual. Otherwise, the flow direction will be toward the edge. Cells that should flow from the edge of the surface to the raster inward will do so. This is the default.

-   `true` —All cells at the edge of the surface raster will flow outward from the surface raster.
