-   `CONSTANT` —The output cell values will all equal 1. This is the default.

-   `UNIQUE` —Each stream will have a unique ID between intersections in the output.

-   `STRAHLER` —The Strahler method, in which stream order only increases when streams of the same order intersect, will be used. The intersection of a first-order and second-order link will remain a second-order link, rather than creating a third-order link.

-   `SHREVE` —The Shreve method, in which stream order is assigned by magnitude, will be used. All links with no tributaries are assigned a magnitude (order) of 1. Magnitudes are additive downslope. When two links intersect, their magnitudes are added and assigned to the downslope link.

-   `HACK` —The Hack method, in which each stream segment is assigned an order greater than the stream or river to which it discharges, will be used. For example, the main river channel is assigned an order of 1, all stream segments discharging to it are assigned an order of 2, any stream discharging to an order 2 stream is assigned an order of 3, and so on.
