The message level associated with the job. The values are the following:

-   `info` 
-   `warn` 
-   `error` 

When constructing a query URL, the `msgLevel`  value is added to the end of the URL, for example, `...jobs/job/<jobID>?msgLevel=info` . 

<Note type={"note"}>

Regardless of the `msgLevel`  value, any errors that a job contains are included in the `messages`  array of the response by default.

</Note>
