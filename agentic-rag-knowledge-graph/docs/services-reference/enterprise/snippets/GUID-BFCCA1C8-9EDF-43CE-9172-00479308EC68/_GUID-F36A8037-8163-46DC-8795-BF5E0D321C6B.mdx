Location-allocation helps you choose which facilities from a set of facilities to operate based on their potential interaction with demand points. It can help you answer questions like the following:

-   Given a set of existing fire stations, which site for a new fire station would provide the best response times for the community?
-   If a retail company has to downsize, which stores should it close to maintain the most overall demand?
-   Where should a factory be built to minimize the distance to distribution centers?

In these examples, facilities would represent the fire stations, retail stores, and factories; demand points would represent buildings, customers, and distribution centers.
