URL based:  For a large set of geometries, you can specify a URL to the input geometries stored in a JSON structure in a file on a public server. The expected format of the fileâ€™s contents will be exactly the same as that expected if the geometries were directly embedded in the request. Syntax: `geometries={ "url" : "<URL to file>" }`  Example: `geometries={ "url" : "http://myserver/mygeometries/afile.txt" }`
