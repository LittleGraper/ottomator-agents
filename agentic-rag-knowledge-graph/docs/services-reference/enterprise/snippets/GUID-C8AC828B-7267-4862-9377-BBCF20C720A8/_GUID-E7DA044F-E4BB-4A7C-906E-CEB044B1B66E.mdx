If the input surface raster has a vertical coordinate system (VCS), the values of the surface raster are considered to be in the units of the VCS. If the input surface raster does not have a VCS and the data is projected, the surface values are considered to be in the linear units of the spatial reference. If the input surface raster does not have a VCS and the data is not projected, the surface values are considered to be in meters.
