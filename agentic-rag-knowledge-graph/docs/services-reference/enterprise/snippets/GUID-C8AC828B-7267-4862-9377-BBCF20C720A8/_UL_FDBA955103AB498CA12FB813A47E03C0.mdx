-   `EACH_ZONE` —For each zone on the input destination data, an optimal path is determined and saved on the output raster. The optimal path for each zone begins at the cell with the lowest cost distance weighting in the zone. This is the default.

-   `BEST_SINGLE` —For all cells on the input destination data, the optimal path is derived from the cell with the minimum of the least-cost paths to source cells.

-   `EACH_CELL` —For each cell with valid values on the input destination data, an optimal path is determined and saved on the output raster. Each cell of the input destination data is treated separately, and a least-cost path is determined for each cell.
