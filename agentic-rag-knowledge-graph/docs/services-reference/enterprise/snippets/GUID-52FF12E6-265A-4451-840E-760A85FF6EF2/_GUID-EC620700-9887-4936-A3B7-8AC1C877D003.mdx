The bearing tolerance value creates a range of acceptable bearing values when locating moving points on an edge using the `Bearing`  field. If the `Bearing`  field value is within the range of acceptable values that are generated from the bearing tolerance on an edge, the point can be added as a network location there; otherwise, the closest point on the next-nearest edge is evaluated.
