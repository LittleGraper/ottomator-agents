The parameter value is specified as a JSON object. The JSON object allows you to specify a locator JSON for all input feature in the analysis, or you can specify an override for a particular input. The override allows you to have different settings for each analysis input. For example, you can disallow stops to locate on highway ramps and allow point barriers to locate on highway ramps. When specifying the `locateSettings`  JSON, you must provide all the properties including `tolerance` , `toleranceUnits` , `sources` , and `allowAutoRelocate`  in the default locator JSON object. The `where`  clause for each source is optional. If you need to provide a different locator JSON for a particular input class, you must include the overrides property for that input. The property name must match the input parameter name. The locator JSON for a particular input doesn't need to include all the properties; you only need to include the properties that are different from the default locator JSON properties.
