-   A value of `true`  specifies that, within any particular area, only cells that have a value in the raster layer being summarized will be used in determining the output value for that area. Any missing or NoData cells will be ignored in the statistics calculations. This is the default.

-   A value of `false`  specifies that, within any particular area, if any cells in the raster layer do not have a value, it is deemed that there is insufficient information to perform statistical calculations for all the cells in that zone. As a result, the entire zone will receive the NoData value on the output raster.
