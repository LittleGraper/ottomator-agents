Validation results for this tool are written to the ArcGIS Server directory. This file is automatically cleaned up using default 10 minute intervals, which may not be enough time to process all of the validations and write them to the workstation that is running ArcGIS Pro. For larger data loads, it is recommended that you [adjust the maximum file age](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/administer/windows/editing-a-server-directory-in-manager.htm) to at least one hour.
