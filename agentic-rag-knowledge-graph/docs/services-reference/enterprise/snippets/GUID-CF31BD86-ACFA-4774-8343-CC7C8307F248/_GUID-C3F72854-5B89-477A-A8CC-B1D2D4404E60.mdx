Returns features edited due to the geodatabase behavior that results from applying the edits. For example, if a feature is deleted and it is the origin in a composite relationship, the destination feature is automatically deleted from the geodatabase. If `returnServiceEditsOption` is set to `originalAndCurrentFeatures`, the deleted destination feature is returned along with a reference to the deleted original feature in the response. Note that, even for deletions, the geometry and attributes of the edited feature are returned.
