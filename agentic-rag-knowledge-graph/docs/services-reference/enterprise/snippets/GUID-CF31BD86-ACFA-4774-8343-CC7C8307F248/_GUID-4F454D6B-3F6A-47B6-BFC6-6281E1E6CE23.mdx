This endpoint is deprecated starting at ArcGIS Server 11.1.

Versioning endpoints in this API—including Create Version, Reconcile Version, and Delete Version—are provided for ArcMap publishing.

In ArcGIS Pro publishing, versioning is handled by the [Version Management Service](/version-management-service), which is required for feature service publishing using branch versioning. This capability handles all ArcGIS Pro versioning-related operations.
