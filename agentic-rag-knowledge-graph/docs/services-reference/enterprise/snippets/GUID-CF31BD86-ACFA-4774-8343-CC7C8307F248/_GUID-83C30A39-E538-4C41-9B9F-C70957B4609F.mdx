ArcGIS Location Referencing stores routes and other network details with different representations across time. This parameter can be used to focus the time view of the network changes to be processed, which is especially useful for external systems that don't support multiple representations of the LRS network across time. For such systems, a specific time snapshot of the LRS can be requested.
