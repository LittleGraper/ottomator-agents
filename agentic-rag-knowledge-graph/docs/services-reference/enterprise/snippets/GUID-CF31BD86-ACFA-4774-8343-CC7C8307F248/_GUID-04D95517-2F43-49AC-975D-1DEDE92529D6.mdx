The response includes no `editedFeatures` values and `exceededTransferLimit` as `true` if the count of edited features to return is more than the `maxRecordCount` value. If clients are using this parameter to maintain a cache, they should invalidate the cache when `exceededTransferLimit` is returned as `true`. If the server encounters an error when generating the list of edits in the response, `exceededTransferLimit` is returned as `true`.
