Route layers cannot be created when the output is a feature collection. The task will produce an error if an `outputName` value is not specified (which indicates feature collection output) and `includeRouteLayers` is set to `true`.

The maximum number of route layers that can be created is 1,000. If the result contains more than 1,000 routes and `includeRouteLayers` is set to `true`, the task will only create the output feature service.
