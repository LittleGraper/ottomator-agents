Travel modes are managed in ArcGIS Online and can be configured by the administrator of your organization to better reflect your organization's workflows. You must specify the JSON object containing the settings for a travel mode supported by your organization. To get a list of supported travel modes, run the `GetTravelModes` operation from the [Utilities service](/gettravelmodes-synchronous-task).
