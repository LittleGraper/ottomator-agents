When `includeRouteLayers` is set to `true`, each route from the result is also saved as a route layer item. A route layer includes all the information for a particular route, such as the stops assigned to the route as well as the travel directions. Creating route layers is useful if you want to share individual routes with other members in your organization. The route layers use the output feature service name provided in the `outputName` parameter as a prefix, and the route name generated as part of the analysis is added to create a unique name for each route layer.
