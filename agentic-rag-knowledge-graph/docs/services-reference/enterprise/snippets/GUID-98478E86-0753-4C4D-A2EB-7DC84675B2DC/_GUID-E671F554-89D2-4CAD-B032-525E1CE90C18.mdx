The [Context](../../../spatial-analysis/reference/spatial-reference) parameter contains the following additional settings that affect task operation:

-   [Extent](../../../spatial-analysis/reference/spatial-reference/#extent) (`extent`)—A bounding box that defines the analysis area. Only input features that intersect the bounding box will be analyzed.
-   [Output spatial reference](../../../spatial-analysis/reference/spatial-reference/#output-spatial-reference) (`outSR`)—The output features will be projected into the output spatial reference.

Syntax:

```javascript
{
  "extent" : {extent},
  "outSR" : {spatial reference}
}

```
