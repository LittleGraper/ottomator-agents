The `context`  parameter contains additional settings that affect task execution. For this task, there are five settings:

-   [Extent](/extent-geoanalytics) (`extent` )—A bounding box that defines the analysis area. Only those features that intersect the bounding box will be analyzed. 
-   [Processing spatial reference](/process-spatial-reference) (`processSR` )—The features will be projected into this coordinate system for analysis.
-   [Output spatial reference](/output-spatial-reference-geoanalytics) (`outSR` )—The features will be projected into this coordinate system after the analysis to be saved. The output spatial reference for the spatiotemporal big data store is always WGS84.
-   [Data store](/outputdatastore) (`dataStore` )—Results will be saved to the specified data store. The default is the spatiotemporal big data store.
-   [Default aggregation styles](/default-aggregation-styles-geoanalytics) (`defaultAggregationStyles` )—If set to `true` , results will have square, hexagon, and triangle aggregation styles enabled on results map services.
