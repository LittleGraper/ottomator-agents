The `context`  parameter contains additional settings that affect task execution. For this task, there are two settings:

-   [Extent](/extent-geoanalytics) (`extent` )—A bounding box that defines the analysis area. Only those features that intersect the bounding box will be analyzed. 
-   [Processing spatial reference](/process-spatial-reference) (`processSR` )—The features will be projected into this coordinate system for analysis.
