Tasks that have the `parallel processing factor`  property in their `context`  parameter allow you to control the number of Raster Processing service instances that can be used for processing your data.

If the task's context parameter doesn't have the [`processor type` ](/processor-type) or if the `processor type`  in the task's `context`  is set as CPU, the `parallelProcessingFactor`  controls Raster Processing (CPU) service instances. If the `processor type`  is set as GPU, the `parallel processing factor`  controls the number of Raster Processing GPU instances.

If the `parallel processing factor`  is not specified, which is the default, one Raster Analysis task will use 80 percent of the maximum number of Raster Processing service instances. Distributed Orthomapping taskâ€™s default is 50 percent.

By setting the `parallel processing factor` , you can request the number of parallel workers that the Raster Analytics Image Server should use to process one Raster Analytic task. However, if the total number of parallel processes exceeds the maximum number of Raster Processing service instances, the additional parallel processes will be queued.

Syntax example with a specified number of processing instances:

```javascript
"parallelProcessingFactor": "2"
```

 

Syntax example with a specified percentage of total processing instances:

```javascript
"parallelProcessingFactor": "60%"
```
