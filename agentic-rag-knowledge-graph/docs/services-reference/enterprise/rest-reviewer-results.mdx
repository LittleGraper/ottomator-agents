## Description

<Note>
The ArcGIS Data Reviewer extension is required to use this resource.
</Note>

<Note>
This resource is dependent on the ArcGIS Data Reviewer ArcMap runtime-based server object extension (SOE). ArcGIS Enterprise 10.9.x, part of the ArcGIS 2021 releases, is the last release of ArcGIS Enterprise to support services published from ArcMap.

Consider Data Reviewer capabilities enabled using ArcGIS Pro and integrated in the [Validation service](/validation-server).
</Note>

The `ReviewerResults` operation allows you to access the Reviewer workspace. Access includes the following functionality:

-   Write data, as results, to the Data Reviewer workspace
-   Query Data Reviewer workspace feature classes and tables
-   Update the lifecycles status of an existing result

You can write both `JSON` geometry and feature objects to a Data Reviewer workspace using the `writeResult` and `writeFeatureAsResult`  operations. The `writeResult` operation writes a `JSON` geometry and Data Reviewer attributes to a Data Reviewer workspace. The `writeFeatureAsResult` operation writes a `JSON` feature object (an object that contains a `JSON` geometry and attribute object) and Data Reviewer attributes to a Data Reviewer workspace. 

Use `getResults` to query the Data Reviewer workspace. Execute the `getLayerDefinition` operation to retrieve a layer definition that you can dynamically apply to the Data Reviewer map service. 

The `getBatchRunDetails` operation fetches batch run information from the Data Reviewer workspace. 

The `updateLifecycleStatus` operation allows you to move a result between lifecycle categories and indicate how a result was handled within a category.
