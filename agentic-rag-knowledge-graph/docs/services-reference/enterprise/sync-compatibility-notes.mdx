## General

New clients need to check the new [Sync capability](/sync-enabled-feature-services) to determine if a feature service has been configured to use sync. 

<Note type={"note"}>

There is also a `syncEnabled`  property, but it is recommended that new clients use the sync capability instead.

</Note>

Older clients have no knowledge of this property; however, properties used by older clients are still supported. Thus, a client written for an older server will continue to work when the server is upgraded to the newest release. 

Older clients check the `supportsDisconnectedEditing`  property to determine if the service supports the API. If `true` , the clients then check properties of the layers to be used with [Create Replica](/create-replica) to ensure the following:

-   All layers must have a GlobalID field.
-   All layers must have the same value for the `syncCanReturnChanges`  property. Either all can return changes on sync (`true` ) or none can return changes on sync (`false` ). If all are `false` , replacement data is returned on sync.

If `supportsDisconnectedEditing`  is `false` , the service cannot take part in sync at all.

## LayerQueries without queryOption

If a service does not have the `syncEnabled`  property or has a value of `false` , the older syntax of `layerQueries`  applies, as below. 

### Description

In addition to the `layers`  and `geometry`  parameters, the `layerQueries`  parameter can be used to further define what is replicated. This parameter allows you to set properties on a per-layer or per-table basis. Only the properties for the layers and tables that you want change from the default are required. The properties include the following:

-   `where` —Defines an attribute query for a layer or table. The default is no where clause.
-   `useGeometry` —Determines whether or not to apply the geometry for the layer. The default is `true` . If set to `false` , features from the layer that intersect the geometry are not added.
-   `includeRelated` —Determines whether or not to add related rows. The default is `true` .

### Syntax

```javascript
layerQueries={ "<Layer_or_tableID1>" : {"where":"attribute_query", "useGeometry": <true | false>, "includeRelated" : <true | false>}, "<Layer_or_tableID2>: {.}}
```

 

### Example

-   `layerQueries={"1":{"useGeometry" : false}}` 
-   `layerQueries={"0":{"where": "requires_inspection" = True}, "1":{"useGeometry " : false}}` 
-   `layerQueries={"0":{"useGeometry" : false, "includeRelated" : false}}, "1":{"useGeometry" : false}}`
