## Overview

The feature service includes a Sync capability which is used when working with maps offline. [Sync-enabled](/using-sync) feature services allow ArcGIS clients to create local copies of the data and sync changes back and forth. 

Sync supports multiple editors where each editor can choose to work with a subset of data. For example, an organization can use sync to collect data from workers deployed with mobile devices in the field. 

Workflows involving read only clients are also supported. For example, a client can sync to keep a local copy up to date with changes made on the server.

The following service resource operations are provided with sync:

-   [ Create Replica](/create-replica) - Sets up a client to run sync. The process creates a replica on the server which is referenced when syncing.
-   [ Synchronize Replica](/synchronize-replica) - Performs the sync.
-   [Unregister Replica](/unregister-replica-feature-service) - Unregisters a replica on the server.

The following topics provide more information on sync:

-   [Using Sync](/using-sync)
-   [Sync workflow examples](/sync-workflow-examples)
-   [Sync compatibility notes](/sync-compatibility-notes)
