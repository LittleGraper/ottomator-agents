<GUID_FDC3EA81_25C0_4AC4_8B57_2008547446AD_GUID_E6C28557_ADDB_4260_92CF_C8983F9552C4 />
</Note>

This operation applies a batch of event or route changes to the editable linear referencing layers in the service.

Currently, only point and linear event layers, network (route) layers, and calibration point layers can be edited.

Edits can only be applied to event feature classes that are local to the LRS geodatabase. External event tables are treated as read-only data sources and do not support web editing.

All edits sent in one request are applied in a single database transaction to maintain data integrity. If any of the individual edits fail, the entire transaction is rolled back and none of the changes are applied. An edit operation can only include layers that exist in a single database workspace. An error message is returned if an edit request specifies layers defined in different workspaces.

<Note type={"note"}>
If [conflict prevention is enabled](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/production/location-referencing-pipelines/conflict-prevention.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_AB482F4ADC1749F595D7E5ADAFEC4C8C), locks must be acquired before running `applyEdits`, or an error that lists the missing locks is returned.

      A batch of changes to apply to the editable layers in the service. Each layer can receive a distinct set of additions, updates, and deletions. The format of the change records depends on the layer type being edited.

      -  Event layer

          An [event layer](/event-layer) can receive a set of add, update, and delete records, a split event record, and a merge events record.

          Event records contain attributes (including measure values) but no geometry, and the attribute names are case sensitive.

          Control merge behavior for linear events using the `allowMerge` option, which can be set to `true` or `false` for each layer being edited. The default is `false`. 

          If `allowMerge` is set to `true` for a linear event layer, each added record is inspected to determine whether it can be merged with any existing event record associated with the same route. Merging two records is possible only if their measure ranges are coincident or overlapping, and all other attribute values are the same. This behavior applies only to additions, not updates or deletions.

          Control retire overlap behavior for linear events using the `retireMeasureOverlap` option, which can be set to `true` or `false` for each layer being edited. The default is `false`.

          If `retireMeasureOverlap` is set to `true` for a linear event layer, each added record is inspected to determine whether it overlaps the measure range of any events associated with the same route. The overlapping portions of any existing events are retired, which entails updating the `ToDate` field value for that record. This behavior applies only to additions, not updates or deletions.

          Control retire by Event ID behavior using the `retireByEventId` option, which can be set to `true` or `false` for each layer being edited. The default is `false`.

          If `retireByEventId` is set to `true` for a point or linear event layer, any existing event records with the same event ID and temporality overlaps as the added records are retired.

          If an event layer is configured to store referent locations for each event record, the `allowMerge` and `retireMeasureOverlap` options preserve the referent location information of existing events whenever possible.

          Syntax for event layer edits:

          ```json
          [
            { 
              "id": <eventLayerId>,
              "allowMerge": <true | false>,
              "retireMeasureOverlap": <true | false>,
              "retireByEventId": <true | false>,
              "adds": [ <record1>, <record2>, ... ],
              "updates": [ <record1>, <record2>, ... ],
              "deletes": [ <record1>, <record2>, ... ],
              "splitEvent": <record>,
              "mergeEvents": <record>
            },
            {
              "id": <eventLayerId>,
              "allowMerge": <true | false>,
              "retireMeasureOverlap": <true | false>,
              "retireByEventId": <true | false>,
              "adds": [ <record1>, <record2>, ... ],
              "updates": [ <record1>, <record2>, ... ],
              "deletes": [ <record1>, <record2>, ... ],
              "splitEvent": <record>,
              "mergeEvents": <record>
            },
            ...
          ]

          ```
          An `add` event record has the format shown below. Each record must contain at least a Route ID attribute value. In addition, point events must contain a Measure value, and linear events must contain From Measure and To Measure values. Attribute names are case sensitive.

          ```json
          {
            "attributes": {
              "<field1>": <value1>,
              "<field2>": <value2>,
              ...
            }
          }

          ```
          An `update` event record has the format shown below. Each record must contain at least the `eventId` property or the `WHERE` property to define the set of records to update. If the `eventId` property is specified, the optional `fromDate` property can be specified to uniquely identify a single record to update out of all the temporal records for a given `eventId`. The attributes object should contain only those attribute values that are to be updated. Attribute names are case sensitive.

          ```json
          {
            "eventId": <eventId>,  // string or number value
            "fromDate": <fromDate>,  // date value
            "where": "<whereClause>",
            "attributes": {
              "<field1>": <value1>,
              "<field2>": <value2>,
              ...
            }
          }

          ```
          A `delete` event record has the format shown below. Each record must contain at least the `eventId` property or the `WHERE` property to define the set of records to delete. If the `eventId` property is specified, the optional `fromDate` property can be specified to uniquely identify a single record to delete out of all the temporal records for a given `eventId`. 

          ```json
          {
            "eventId": <eventId>,  // string or number value
            "fromDate": <fromDate>,  // date value
            "where": "<whereClause>"
          }

          ```
          A `split` event record has the format shown below. The record must contain the `objectId`, `measure`, and `fromDate` properties. The `routeId` property is optional for non-spanning events and is required for spanning events. The `toDate` property is optional and is assumed `null` if not specified. The `attributes` and `attributes2` objects are optional and should contain attribute values for the two new event records after the split. Attribute names are case sensitive.

          ```json
          {
            "objectId": <objectId>,  // string or number value
            "routeId": <routeId>,  // string value
            "measure": <measure>,  // double value
            "fromDate": <fromDate>,  // date value
            "toDate": <toDate>,  // date value
            "attributes": {
              "<field1>": <value1>,
              "<field2>": <value2>,
              ...
            },
            "attributes2": {
              "<field1>": <value1>,
              "<field2>": <value2>,
              ...
            }
          }

          ```
          A `merge` event record has the format shown below. The record must contain `objectIds`, `objectIdToPreserve`, `fromDate`, and `toDate` properties. The `toDate` property is optional and is assumed null if not specified. The `attributes` object is optional and should contain attribute values for the new event record after merge. If `attributes` object is not provided, attributes of the `preserve` event will be used. Attribute names are case sensitive.

          ```json
          {
            "objectIds": [<objectId1>, <objectId2>, ...], // two or more object IDs to merge
            "objectIdToPreserve": <objectId>,  // object ID of preserve event
            "fromDate": <fromDate>,  // date value
            "toDate": <toDate>,  // date value
            "attributes": {
              "<field1>": <value1>,
              "<field2>": <value2>,
              ...
            }
          }

          ```
      - Network layer

          A network (route) layer can receive create, extend, realign, reassign, retire, delete, reverse, or rename records. Attribute names in edit records are case sensitive.

          Syntax for network layer edits:

          ```json
          [
            { 
              "id": <networkLayerId>,
              // include only one of the following record types:
              "createRoute": <record>
              "extendRoute": <record>
              "realignRoute": <record>
              "reassignRoute": <record>
              "retireRoute": <record>
              "deleteRoutes": <record>
              "reverseRoute": <record>
              "renameRoute": <record>
            },
            { 
              "id": <networkLayerId>,
              // include only one of the following record types:
              "createRoute": <record>
              "extendRoute": <record>
              "realignRoute": <record>
              "reassignRoute": <record>
              "retireRoute": <record>
              "deleteRoutes": <record>
              "reverseRoute": <record>
              "renameRoute": <record>         
            },
            ...
          ]

          ```
          A `create route` record has the format shown below. The `attributes` object must include a route name and can optionally include route from and to dates, and any other fields from the network layer except route ID, line ID, and line order. If the network layer represents a line network, the attributes must include a line name. The route ID and line ID fields are automatically generated by the `applyEdits` operation and should not be included in the attributes object. Optionally, the `flippedCenterlineObjectIds` object includes a list of centerline object IDs to reverse its direction in memory.

          ```json
          {
            "centerlineObjectIds": [<objectId1>, <objectId2>, ...],
            "flippedCenterlineObjectIds": [<objectId2>, ...],
            "fromMeasure": <measure>,
            "toMeasure": <measure>,
            "attributes": {
              "<fieldName1>": <value1>,
              "<fieldName2>": <value2>,
              ...
            }
          }

          ```
          An `extend route` record has the format shown below. The `newRouteAttributes` object must include a route name and can optionally include any other fields from the network layer except route ID, line ID, line name, line order, from date, and to date. Those fields are automatically derived from other request properties and from the route being edited. Optionally, the `flippedCenterlineObjectIds` object includes a list of centerline object IDs to reverse its direction in memory.

          ```json
          {
            "effectiveDate": <date>,

            ]
          }

          ```
          A `reassign route` record has the format shown below. The `sourceToRouteId` property is only applicable for networks that support lines. If `sourceToRouteId` is not provided, it is assumed that `sourceRouteId` and `sourceToRouteId` values are the same.

          }
          ```
      - Calibration point layer

          A calibration point layer can receive a set of add, update, and delete records. These edits must be performed separately and should not be combined with network (route) or event edits. 

          Syntax for calibration point layer edits: 

          ```json
          [
            {

            "recalibrateRouteDownstream": <recalibrateRouteDownstream> // boolean value
            "retire": <retire> // boolean value. defaults to false
          }

          ```
          An `update calibration point` record has the format shown below. Each record must contain at least an Object ID attribute value to update a calibration point. Although the attribute values for From Date, To Date, Measure, and Recalibrate Route Downstream are optional, at least one attribute value must be passed along with the Object ID attribute.

          ```json
          {
            "objectId": <objectId>,
            "fromDate": <fromDate>,  // date value

            "objectId": <objectId>
          }
          ```
      - Centerline layer

          A centerline layer supports splitting a centerline at a specific location. These edits must be performed separately and should not be combined with network (route), event, or calibration point edits.

          Syntax for centerline layer edits: 

          ```json
          [
            {
              "id": <centerlineLayerId>,
              "splitCenterline": <record>
            },
            ...
          ]
          ```
          A `splitCenterline` record has the format shown below: 

          ```json

              "y":<y>,
              "spatialReference":<spatialReference>
          }
          }

          ```
          A `splitCenterlinesIntoSingleparts` record has the format shown below. This API separates the component parts of a multipart feature into singlepart features while maintaining the underlying network to centerline relationship.

          ```json
          {
            "objectIds": [<oid1>, <oid2>, ..]
          }

```

### Example 16

A URL for splitting an event is shown.

```other
https://sampleserver/arcgis/rest/services/MyLRS/MapServer/exts/LRServer/applyEdits?f=json&edits=[{"id":2,"splitEvent":{"objectId":4801,"routeId":"{78F14930-E693-45A9-B895-6595932E5650}","measure":255.16499999999999,"fromDate":1651536000000,"toDate":253402300799999,"attributes":{"dblField":1,"NotNull":2},"attributes2":{"dblField":null,"NotNull":4}}}]
```

### Example 17

A URL for merging two events is shown.

```other
https://sampleserver/arcgis/rest/services/MyLRS/MapServer/exts/LRServer/applyEdits?f=json&edits=[{"id":2,"mergeEvents":{"objectIds":[4801,4802],"objectIdToPreserve":4801,"fromDate":1651536000000,"toDate":253402300799999,"attributes":{"dblField":1,"NotNull":2}}}]

## JSON Response syntax

Example of a successful response

```json
{
  "success": true
}
 
```

 

If an error occurs, the operation fails and rolls back, for example, if any line (or route) that is being edited has a lock.

```json
{
  "error": { "code": <errorCode>, "message": "<errorMessage>" }, 
  "missingLocks": {
    {"networkId": "<networkId>", "routeId": "<routeId>"}, 
    {"networkId": "<networkId>", "lineId": "<lineId>"}, ...}
}

```

 

Example of a successful split centerline response

<Note type={"note"}>
At 10.9 or later, this result is an array of new centerline object IDs that were created as part of the split operation. In earlier releases, the response format had a single `objectId` value.
</Note>

```json
{
  "objectIds": [newCenterlineOID1, newCenterlineOID2, ...]     
}
```

 

Example of a successful split event or merge events response

```json
{
  "objectIds": [newEventOID1, newEventOID2, ...]     
}

```
