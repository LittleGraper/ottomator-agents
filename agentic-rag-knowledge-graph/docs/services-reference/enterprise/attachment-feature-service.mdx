## Description

An individual attachment resource represents an individual attachment associated with a [ feature](/feature-object). This resource is available only if the layer has advertised that it has attachments. A layer has attachments if its `hasAttachments`  property is `true` .

The contents of the attachment are streamed to the client. Attachments are returned within an [ attachmentInfos](/attachment-infos-feature-service) resource. If the attachment is not found, an error is returned.

The response returned for this resource is a download of the attachment.

## New at 11.1

The following update has been made for non-hosted feature services (referencing enterprise geodatabases) published from ArcGIS Pro:

-    The `w`  parameter is now supported for qualifying non-hosted feature services. The `w`  parameter returns attachments resized to a pixel width based on the value set for `w` . A non-hosted feature service's support for the `w`  parameter is indicated when the service-level `supportsAttachmentsResizing`  property is set to `true` .

## New at 10.9.1

Hosted feature service attachment resources support the `w`  parameter, which returns attachments resized to a pixel width matching the `w`  parameter's value. The `supportsAttachmentsResizing`  layer property is set to `true`  when the `w`  parameter is supported.

## Request parameters

<StyledTable headers={"Parameter,Details"}>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`w` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

An integer value that describes the width to resize an attachment image to when returned with the attachment resource. The resizing maintains the aspect ratio and is only applied to attachment images. Images cannot be made larger that the stored image by setting a larger `w`  value. Sizes may also be snapped to the nearest preset size. By default, a value for `w`  is not set, and the full resolution of the image is returned. This parameter is only supported when the `supportsAttachmentsResizing`  layer property is set to `true` .

Example

```javascript
w=100
```

 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

</StyledTable>

## Example usage
