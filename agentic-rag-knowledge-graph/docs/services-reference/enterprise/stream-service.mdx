## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

ArcGIS Server must be licensed as an ArcGIS GeoEvent Server to use this resource.

</Note>

A stream service is a type of ArcGIS GeoEvent Server service that emphasizes low latency and real-time data dissemination for client and server data flows.

ArcGIS GeoEvent Server must be licensed and installed in your enterprise GIS to use stream services. Stream service content can be used in ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise web maps or clients developed using the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript. See [Introduction to ArcGIS GeoEvent Server](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/geoevent/latest/get-started/what-is-arcgis-geoevent-server.htm) for more information.

Hosting a stream service on ArcGIS GeoEvent Server allows administrators to broadcast event data over the stream service and enables clients to subscribe to a stream service and immediately begin receiving data.

The REST API stream service resource provides basic information about the service including event attribute fields, geometry type, and WebSocket resources used by the service.

See [Stream services](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/publish-services/linux/stream-services.htm) for more information.

## Example usage

The following is a sample request URL used to query a hypothetical service named `AircraftLocations` on a local ArcGIS GeoEvent Server:

```other
https://<machineName>.<domain>.com/webadaptor/rest/services/AircraftLocations/StreamServer?f=pjson
```
