## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

Globe services were deprecated in ArcGIS Enterprise 10.5.

</Note>

This resource represents a single cached tile for a globe service layer. The image bytes for the tile at the specified face, level, row, and column are directly streamed to the client. If the tile is not found, an HTTP status code of 404 (Not found) is returned. 

## Example usage

Example: Request a tile from a service named globe for layer 1, face 0, level 11, row 3, and column 0.
