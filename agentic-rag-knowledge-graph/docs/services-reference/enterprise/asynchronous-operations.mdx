Sync supports options for asynchronous processing with the [createReplica](/create-replica) and [synchronizeReplica](/synchronize-replica) operations. The following example illustrates the usage of an asynchronous operation.

## Asynchronous processing with `synchronizeReplica` 

Synchronizing a replica with the `async`  parameter set to `true`  returns a location to a status resource in the `statusUrl` .

### JSON Response syntax

```other
{
  "statusURL": "<url>"
}
```

 

### JSON Response example

```other
{
  "statusUrl": "https://services.myserver.com/ERmEceOGq5cHrItq/ArcGIS/rest/services/USA/FeatureServer/jobs/jf90d6386f7494cd59c024f749773fe7b"
}
```

 

## Status responses

The status resource includes the current status of the process as well as the replica name, the process start time, and the last time a status update was provided. If the status is anything other than `Completed` , `CompletedWithErrors` , or `Failed` , the client can call `Get`  on the resource for a status update. 

When the status is `Completed` , the resource includes the results in a `resultUrl` . A `resultUrl`  is provided even if the operation was called with the `transportType`  parameter set to `esriTransportTypeEmbedded` .

The following shows JSON request and response examples and syntax for the status resource.

### JSON Request example

```other
https://services.myserver.com/ERmEceOGq5cHrItq/ArcGIS/rest/services/USA/FeatureServer/createReplica/26bba818-15f7-47b5-9ae3-f6f9a7b781ed?statusId=26bba818-15f7-47b5-9ae3-f6f9a7b781ed
```

 

### JSON Response syntax

```other
{
  "transportType": "esriTransportTypeURL",
  "responseType": "<esriReplicaResponseTypeData | esriReplicaResponseTypeInfo>",
  "replicaName": "<Name>",
  "resultUrl": "<result Uri>",
  "submissionTime": <T1>,   //Time since epoch in milliseconds
  "lastUpdatedTime" : <T2>, //Time since epoch in milliseconds
  "status": "<Pending | InProgress | Completed | Failed ImportChanges | ExportChanges | ExportingData | ExportingSnapshot | ExportAttachments | ImportAttachments | ProvisioningReplica | UnRegisteringReplica | CompletedWithErrors>"
}
```

 

### JSON Response examples

The following is a sample response where `status`  is returned as `InProgress` :

```other
{  
  "transportType": "esriTransportTypeURL",
  "responseType": "esriReplicaResponseTypeData",
  "replicaName": "MyReplica",
  "resultUrl": "", 
  "submissionTime": 1379366893000,
  "lastUpdatedTime": 1379366896000,
  "status": "InProgress"
}
```

 

The following is a sample response where `status`  is returned as `Completed` :

```other
{  
  "transportType": "esriTransportTypeURL",
  "responseType": "esriReplicaResponseTypeData",
  "replicaName": "MyReplica", 
  "resultUrl": "https://services.myserver.com/ERmEceOGq5cHrItq/ArcGIS/rest/services/USA/replicafiles/e75aaca03a6d46a98c9b3986bc625b78.json",
  "submissionTime": "1335205911000",
  "lastUpdatedTime": "1335206031000",
  "status": "Completed"
}
```
