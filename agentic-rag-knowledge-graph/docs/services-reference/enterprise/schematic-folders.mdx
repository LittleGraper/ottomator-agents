## Description

The `folders` resource represents the set of schematic folders in the schematic dataset(s) related to the schematic layers under a schematic service. It is returned as an array of [Schematic Folder Object](/schematic-folder-object) by the REST API.

<Note type={"tip"}>

When consuming a schematic service under which there is a large number of schematic diagrams, you will have quicker response when displaying the list of the published diagrams if those diagrams are organized by schematic folders instead of being all stored at the schematic dataset root.
