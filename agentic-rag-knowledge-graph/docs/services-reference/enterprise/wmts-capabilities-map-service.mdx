## Description

An individual WMTS Capabilities (Service Metadata) resource allows WMTS clients to retrieve service metadata for this tiled map service. Users can request the WMTS capabilities in both RESTful and Key-Value Pair (KVP) syntax as defined by OGC WMTS specification.

There are no request parameters, and the response is an XML document containing service metadata about the server, including information related to getting the cached map tiles.

## Example usage

The following is a sample request URL used to access an individual WMTS Capabilities resource:

```javascript
https://machine.domain.com/webdaptor/rest/services/WorldTimeZones/MapServer/WMTS/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml
```

 

## XML Response schema

The xml schema for WMTS ServiceMetadata response is available [here](http://schemas.opengis.net/wmts/1.0/wmtsGetCapabilities_response.xsd).
