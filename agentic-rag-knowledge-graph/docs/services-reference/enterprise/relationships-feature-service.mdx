## Description

The `relationships`  resource includes relationship class information for the layers and tables in a specific service, including information about relationship rules from the back-end relationship classes and relationship information already found in individual layers and tables. The `relationships`  resource allows applications to get all the information in one resource, rather than having to piece together the relationships information in each individual layer and table.

Services that support the relationships resource will have the `supportsRelationshipsResource`  property set as `true`  on their service resource.

For more information on relationship classes in enterprise geodatabases, see [Relationship class properties](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/relationships/relationship-class-properties.htm).

<Note type={"note"}>

If your relationship class has subtypes, you do not need to define any rules. However, if you define rules for even one of your relationship class subtypes, you must define rules for all of them.

</Note>

## New at 11.3

-	Reference feature services support user defined relationship IDs for relationship classes published from ArcGIS Pro 3.3. Each relationship id is still a unique integer value across the relationship classes in the feature service, but now it can be user defined rather than generated by the system.

## New at 11.1

The following update has been made for enterprise hosted feature services running on a relational data store:

-    This resource is now supported for qualifying hosted feature services. Support for this is indicated when the service-level `supportsRelationshipsResource`  property is `true` .

The following update has been made for non-hosted feature services (referencing enterprise geodatabases) published from ArcGIS Pro:

-    The `catalogID`  property has been added to the relationships array returned by the `relationships`  resource.

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

In a non-attributed relationship, the `originForeignKey`  is the foreign key in the destination relationship class which relates the rows of the destination layer or table to the origin layer or table. In an attributed relationship, `originForeignKey`  is the foreign key in the intermediate table, which relates the rows of the intermediate table to the origin layer or table.

</StyledTableCell>

`relationshipTableId` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The ID of the intermediate table in the feature service for attributed relationships.

</Note>

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`rules` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

If the relationship class has relationship rules, the rules array will list information about each rule. If no rules are defined, an empty array is returned. The each rule has the following properties:

`ruleID`  - The unique ID of the relationship rule.

`originSubtypeCode`  - The user defined subtype code in the origin table that the relationship rule applies to. 

<Note type={"note"}>

Check the origin layer for the `subTypeField`  property. If `"subTypeField": ""` , you can ignore the `originSubtypeCode`  property in the relationship rule as the origin layer does not contain subtypes.

</Note>

`originMinimumCardinality`  - The minimum amount of relationships allowed from the origin table to the destination table. A -1 value for this property means no minimum has been defined.

`originMaximumCardinality`  - The maximum amount of relationships allowed from the origin table to the destination table. A -1 value for this property means no maximum has been defined.

`destinationSubtypeCode`  – The user defined subtype code in the destination table that the relationship rule applies to.

<Note type={"note"}>

Check the destination layer for the `subTypeField`  property. If `"subTypeField"`  is empty, you can ignore the `destinationSubtypeCode`  property in the relationship rule, as the destination layer does not contain subtypes.

</Note>

`destinationMinimumCardinality`  – The minimum amount of relationships allowed from the destination table to the origin table. A -1 value for this property means no minimum has been defined.

`destinationMinimumCardinality`  - The maximum amount of relationships allowed from the destination table to the origin table. A -1 value for this property means no maximum has been defined.

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`cardinality` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The cardinality of the relationships as a combination of origin and destination cardinalities. When you create a relationship class, you create it with an initial cardinality, such as one-to-many or many-to-many. 

In a real system, however, relationship cardinalities are more specific. Once you've created the relationship class, you can refine the cardinality by creating rules. 

Relationship rules allow you to restrict the type of objects in the origin feature class or table that can be related to a certain kind of object in the destination feature class or table.

Values: `esriRelCardinalityOneToOne`  \| `esriRelCardinalityOneToMany`  \| `esriRelCardinalityManyToMany` 

If an object in the origin table can be related to only one object in the destination table, the relationship cardinality is `esriRelCardinalityOneToOne` . If an object in the origin table can be related to multiple objects in the destination table, the relationship cardinality is `esriRelCardinalityOneToMany` . If an object in the origin table can be related to multiple objects in the destination table and an object in the destination table can be related to multiple objects in the origin table, the relationship cardinality is `esriRelCardinalityManyToMany` . 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`attributed` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Indicates whether the relationship is attributed.

Values: `true`  \| `false` 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`composite` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Indicates whether the relationship is composite.

Values: `true`  \| `false` 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`catalogID` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Introduced at ArcGIS Enterprise 11.1. A universal identifier from the back-end data store. This value can be used, for example, by the UUID for the relationship class in the back-end enterprise geodatabse.
