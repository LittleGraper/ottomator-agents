</Note>

The `dataModel`  resource defines the types of entities and relationships that can be created in a [knowledge graph service](/kgs-hosted-server) as well as some additional settings.

The `dataModel`  resource allows clients to query and edit the entity types and their properties, as well as the relationship types and their properties. By defining these types and their properties, the data model defines the schema of the graph.
