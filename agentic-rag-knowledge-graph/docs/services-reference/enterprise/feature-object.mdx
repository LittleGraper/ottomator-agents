A feature consists of the following two properties. All properties are optional.

* The `geometry` specifies the feature geometry. It can be any of the supported geometry types. It is a JSON object as defined in the [Geometry Objects](/geometry-objects) documentation.
* The `attributes` property specifies the feature attributes. It is a JSON object that contains a dictionary of name-value pairs. The names are the feature field names. The values are the field values, and they can be any of the standard JSON types: string, number, and boolean. Note that date values are encoded as numbers. The number represents the number of milliseconds since epoch (January 1, 1970) in UTC.
