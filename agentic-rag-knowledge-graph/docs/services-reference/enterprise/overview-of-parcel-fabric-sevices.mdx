The parcel fabric accesses data using the following services:

-   Map service
-   Feature service
-   Parcel fabric service
-   Version management service
-   Validation service

The [parcel fabric service](/parcel-fabric-service) performs parcel management and editing operations such as building parcels, merging parcels and assigning parcels to records. The [version management service](/version-management-service) is used to start and stop an edit session on a version when performing parcel editing operations. The [validation service](/validation-server) is used to validate the parcel fabric topology. 

To view the REST endpoints of these services, use the following URLS:
