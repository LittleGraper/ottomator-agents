Raster analysis tasks typically have a raster as input. Rasters can be added as an input in multiple ways: 

-   A URL to an image service layer.
-   A portal `itemId`  to an image layer.

Input raster as a URL to an image service layer.

```javascript
{
  "url": "<url to image service layer>"
}

```

 

Starting at 10.6, an input image service can be secured. If your service is secured, you will need to provide a token (and possibly a referrer) along with the URL so that the analysis service can access it. A long-lived token can be obtained from the token server. For details on acquiring the token, see [Acquiring ArcGIS tokens](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/administer/windows/acquiring-arcgis-tokens.htm).

Example of providing a token to the image service URL.

```javascript
{
  "url": "<url to image service layer>?token=<token of the service>&referer=<base url 
   of the client app>"
}

```

 

Input raster as a portal itemId.

```javascript
{
  "itemId": "f126c8da131543019b05e4bfab6fc6ac",
}

```

 

Currently the supported input image service layer has to be published on the same portal or from a public server.
