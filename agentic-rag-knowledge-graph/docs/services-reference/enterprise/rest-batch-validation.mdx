## Description

<Note>
The ArcGIS Data Reviewer extension is required to use this resource.
</Note>

<Note>
This resource is dependent on the ArcGIS Data Reviewer ArcMap runtime-based server object extension (SOE). ArcGIS Enterprise 10.9.x, part of the ArcGIS 2021 releases, is the last release of ArcGIS Enterprise to support services published from ArcMap.

Consider Data Reviewer capabilities enabled using ArcGIS Pro and integrated in the [Validation service](/validation-server).
</Note>

Batch validation executes a Data Reviewer batch job within ArcGIS Data Reviewer. A batch job represents a quality control model containing groups of Data Reviewer checks. Checks validate data based on conditions, rules and spatial relationships. Checks also specify sets of features or rows to validate. The validation process verifies that features, or rows, conform to rules defined within the model. Validation results are written to the Data Reviewer workspace. 

Reviewer batch jobs are stored as `.rbj` files. You can create batch jobs and save them as `.rbj` files using Data Reviewer tools in ArcGIS Data Reviewer.

To execute batch validation, you must upload `.rbj` files to the Data Reviewer map server. Use the ArcGIS Server [uploads](/upload) functionality to upload `.rbj` files. This operation returns the GUID of an uploaded item. Use this GUID in the **Batch Job File Item Id** setting of the [executeJob](/rest-execute-job)  and [scheduleNewJob](/rest-schedule-new-job) operations.

Batch Validation operates in two execution modes: adhoc (immediate) or scheduled. Requests to the `BatchValidation` resource will return a collection for each mode. Each item in the collection represents a job. Clicking on the item exposes job specific functionality including [editJob](/rest-edit-job), [enableJob](/rest-enable-job), [disableJob](/rest-disable-job) and [deleteJob](/rest-delete-job). 

[scheduleNewJob](/rest-schedule-new-job) allows you to schedule and queue jobs for execution. [executeJob](/rest-execute-job) immediately starts validation. Both methods execute asynchronously.

[scheduleNewJob](/rest-schedule-new-job) requires a schedule format as a cron expression. 

<Note>
Cron expressions represent times and dates as seconds, minutes, hours, day-of-month, month, day-of-week, year, in number and wildcard characters.
