## Description

This operation queries the LRS locks table and returns a list of lock records that match the `WHERE` clause.

An error response is returned from this operation when conflict prevention is not enabled on the LRS. Refer to the `conflictPreventionEnabled` property of the [Locks](/lr-locks) resource.

The `eventFeatureClassName` property in the response is populated for event lock objects and left empty for route lock objects.

##  Request Parameters 

<StyledTable headers={"Parameter,Details"}>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      `f`

      (Optional)
    </StyledTableCell>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      <GUID_CF31BD86_ACFA_4774_8343_CC7C8307F248_GUID_338B692C_1241_497E_A75E_A120E90C5078 />
      <GUID_CF31BD86_ACFA_4774_8343_CC7C8307F248_GUID_A18843D2_866B_4EFB_B533_9736C6767514 />
    </StyledTableCell>
  </StyledTableRow>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      `WHERE`

      (Required)
    </StyledTableCell>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      A `WHERE` clause for the query filter. Any legal SQL `WHERE` clause that operates on LRS locks table fields is allowed.
      <Note type={"note"}>
      For branch versioned databases, the version GUID is stored in the LRS locks table instead of the version name. Ensure the `WHERE` clause includes the GUID instead of the name. You can find more information about branch versions by querying the versions endpoint in the [Version Management Service](/versions).
      </Note>
    </StyledTableCell>
  </StyledTableRow>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      `returnReleasableStatus`

      (Optional)
    </StyledTableCell>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
      Specifies whether the response will contain the `releasableStatus` property. If `returnReleasableStatus` is set to `true`, the server will add a `releasableStatus` attribute to every object of the locks array in the response. 
      The possible `releasableStatus` values are:
      - `no`—When the current user does not hold the lock.
      - `yes`—When the current user holds the lock, but no edits have been made in the version associated with the lock on the line, route (or anything related to it such as a calibration point, centerline sequence, and so on), or event (in the case of an event lock).
      - `onPost`—When the current user holds the lock and the version associated with it has been modified by changes to the line, route (or anything related to it such as a calibration point, centerline sequence, and so on), or event (in the case of an event lock).

## Example Usage

The following examples demonstrate lock queries by attribute.

<EncodeURLsNote />

### Example 1

URL for querying locks by version name.
