## 11.4

The updates and changes described below are effective at ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4.

### Feature services

The updates and changes below apply to feature services.

#### General updates

The updates below have been added, in general, for hosted feature services and reference feature services (referencing enterprise geodatabases).

- The [service-](/apply-edits-feature-service) and [layer-level](/apply-edits-feature-service-layer) Apply Edits operations now support `pbf` as an upload format.
- A new service-level operation, [Get Estimates](/get-estimate-feature-service), has been added. This new operation can be called on multiple layers at once, as compared to the [layer-level Get Estimates operation](/get-estimates-feature-servicelayer) that can only be performed on one layer at a time.
- In addition to the existing windows based time zone properties, IANA time zone properties have been added at 11.4.
- The service-level `fullExtent` property, and layer-level `extent` property, can now include m and z values (when applicable).

####  Enterprise geodatabase data

The following updates apply to reference feature services (referencing enterprise geodatabases).

- An option has been added to include applicable attribute rules in the mobile geodatabase generated by the Create Replica operation. For more information, see [Using syncDataOptions](/create-replica/#using-syncdataoptions)
- The `SharedTemplateEditing` capability has been added for editing shared templates using the REST API.
- The layer-level [Query](/query-feature-service-layer) operation now supports an option to return envelopes for features instead of geometries.
- Support has been added for applying edits and returning query results as pbf with control points.

#### Hosted feature services

The following updates apply, in general, to hosted feature services:

-	The following administrative operations now support performing requests asynchronously:

  - [Add To Definition (Feature Layer)](/add-to-definition-feature-layer)
  - [Add to Definition (Feature Service)](/add-to-definition-feature-service)
  - [Delete From Definition (Feature Layer)](/delete-from-definition-feature-layer)
  - [Delete From Definition (Feature Service)](/delete-from-definition-feature-service)
  - [Update Definition (Feature Layer)](/update-definition-feature-layer)
  - [Update Definition (Feature Service)](/update-definition-feature-service)

The following updates apply to hosted feature services running on a relational data store:

- Full text search indexes can be created for hosted feature services using the [Add to Definition](/add-to-definition-feature-layer) operation. These indexes can then be used to perform full text queries using the layer-level [Query](/query-feature-service-layer) operation.
- Subtypes can now be added and edited using the layer-level [Add To Definition](/add-to-definition-feature-layer), [Update Definition](/update-definition-feature-layer), and [Delete From Definition](/delete-from-definition-feature-layer) administrative operations.
- The layer-level [Append](/append-feature-service-layer/#time-zone) operation supports a new `dateFieldsTimeReference` property, which describes the time zone of the date data values that will be appended. The value is set inside the `appendSourceInfo` parameter and is used to convert the values to UTC when stored by a feature service.

### Linear Referencing Service

The following enhancements have been made:

- The [Query Attribute Set](/query-attribute-set) operation supports point event layers as inputs.

### Map services

The updates and changes below apply to map services.

- The [service-](/export) operation supports highlighting selected features.
- String based unique IDs are supported at 11.4 for query layers published from enterprise databases. Additional information are available inside a new property named `uniqueIdInfo` in layer resources.
- In addition to the existing windows based time zone properties, IANA time zone properties have been added at 11.4.
- Two new properties `maxUniqueIDCount`, `maxSelectionCount` are added to layer resources.

### Print services

The updates and changes below apply to map services.

- Print service now allows turning on or off dynamic-legend behavior for legend elements.
- Response from Get Layout Template Infos includes `dynamicLegends` property for legend elements for each layout template.

### Publishing tools

Three new operations have been added at this release:

- [Export Service](/export-service): This operation exports the service definition for a map service (both by-reference and by-value) or a hosted feature service. The resulting service definition can then be published to a new ArcGIS Enterprise organization. When publishing the service definition to the new organization, users will have the option to preserve the service's `itemID` values.
- [GetServiceDatastoreInfo](/get-service-datastore-info): This operation lists the data stores a service uses, and how specifically the service uses the data stores. This operation is only applicable to map services. Before exporting a map service's service definition, this operation should be performed, as the response can be used to retrieve the full set of data store connection information for each data store the map service uses.
- [Is Datastore Registered](/is-datastore-registered): This operation should be performed in the receiving organization where the exported map service definition will be published. The operation checks whether a specific data store has been registered with an organization. An exported map service definition cannot be published in the receiving organization if its associated data stores are not also registered with the organization.

### Raster analysis tasks

The [Geographic Transformation](/geographic-transformations) environment has been added to all raster analysis tasks that honor the [outSR](/output-spatial-reference) environment.

The following raster analysis tasks have been enhanced:

- The [DistanceAccumulation](/distance-accumulation), [DistanceAllocation](/distance-allocation), [OptimalPathAsLine](/optimal-path-as-line) and [OptimalPathAsRaster](/optimal-path-as-raster) tasks can now properly handle the edge of the projection at a global extent, when using either a cylindrical projection or a geographic output coordinate system and the `geodesic` method.
- Cost raster values that are negative or zero are invalid but will now be treated as small positive values, previously they were treated as NoData in the `DistanceAccumulation`, `DistanceAllocation` and [OptimalRegionConnections](/optimal-region-connections) tasks. 


### Topographic Production Service

The following enhancements have been made:

- The Multinational Geospatial Co-production Program (MGCP) Topographic Map (MTM) map product is supported at a 1:25,000 map scale.
- Standalone ArcGIS Server deployments are supported.
- The [SelectionOperation](/tps-add-product/#productdefinition-properties) operation can update multiple feature selections at once.
- You can publish a [service definition](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/publish-services/linux/about-service-definition-files.htm) (.sd) shared from ArcGIS Pro without the service already enabled.
- You can extract a raster to different raster types when using the [generateProduct operation](/tps-generate-product).
- REST endpoint returned errors support HTML.

### Validation Service

The [writeErrorsWithSketchGeometries](/validation-server) is a new capability for the [writeErrors](/write-errors) operation. The `writeErrors` operation has the new property, `objectIdSketchGeometryPairs` for the `errors` parameter to enhance support for writing different types of sketched geometries to their corresponding GDB_Validation*Errors table.

## 11.3

The updates and changes described below are effective at ArcGIS Enterprise 11.3.

- The `esriFieldTypeTimeOnly`, `esriFieldTypeDateOnly`, `esriFieldTypeTimestampOffset`, and `esriFieldTypeBigInteger` field types have exited beta and are now supported. The sync capability is not supported when these field types are present other than for services with Utility Network data. Note that `esriFieldTypeTimestampOffset` is not supported with hosted feature services from a relational data store or PostgreSQL geodatabases in ArcGIS Enterprise. 
- The feature service REST API now supports one-way feature service-to-feature service sync workflows.

#### Enterprise geodatabase data

The following updates apply to reference feature services (referencing enterprise geodatabases):

- An option has been added for taking a subset of a full model Utility Network offline and syncing. 
- Reference feature services expose a new REST API for [querying shared templates](/query-shared-templates) that have been authored in your back-end enterprise geodatabase.
- [Service webhooks](DEVSITE/rest/enterprise-administration/server/create-webhook) can now be configured for services with branch versioned data.
- Reference feature services supports [applying edits](/apply-edits-feature-service) and returning [query results](/query-feature-service-layer) in JSON with control points.
- The [Query Analytic](/query-analytic) operation has been expanded to support performing the operation asynchronously.
- Reference map services and feature services can be published with explicit relationship ids starting in ArcGIS Pro 3.3.

#### Hosted feature services

The following updates apply, in general, to hosted feature services:

- Hosted feature services support a new layer-level operation, [Query Bins](/query-bins). This operation returns an array of results divided into bins based on numeric or date fields. The response includes statistical aggregations for each bin, such as a count or average for returning aggregated query results.
- Support has been added for appending content from one feature service layer to another within the same organization.
- The layer-level [Query](/query-feature-service-layer) operation supports a new parameter, `defaultSR`.
- The layer-level Query operation now supports querying for either null or not null shapes using a “shape is not null” or “shape is null” WHERE clause.

The following updates apply to hosted feature services running on a relational data store:

- Joined views can be created from source layers with editor tracking enabled. 
- The layer-level Query operation supports an option to return envelopes instead of geometries for features.


#### Cloud Data Warehouse (CDW) feature services

Support for geography type shape fields has been added for a Snowflake data source in ArcGIS Enterprise 11.3.

- [Zonal Statistics](/zonal-statistics)—Summarizes the values of a raster within the zones of another dataset.

The following raster analysis tasks have been enhanced:

- The [DistanceAccumulation](/distance-accumulation) and [DistanceAllocation](/distance-allocation) raster analysis tasks have two new Vertical Factor options added, `HIKING_TIME` and `BIDIR_HIKING_TIME`. The performance has also been improved when using the Geodesic method or Vertical or Horizontal parameters.
- [Summarize Raster Within](/summarize-raster-within)—Four new `statisticType` options are added, `MAJORITY_COUNT`, `MAJORITY_PERCENT`, `MINORITY_COUNT`, and `MINORITY_PERCENT`.
- [Zonal Statistics As Table](/zonal-statistics-as-table)—Six new `statisticType` options are added, `MAJORITY_COUNT`, `MAJORITY_PERCENT`, `MINORITY_COUNT`, `MINORITY_PERCENT`, `MAJORITY_VALUE_COUNT_PERCENT`, and `MINORITY_VALUE_COUNT_PERCENT`.

### Routing services

[Last Mile Delivery](/last-mile-delivery-service) is a new network analysis service that focuses on the subset of vehicle routing problems associated with delivering packages to their final customers. 

### Utility network service

The [trace](/trace-utility-network-server) and [create (Trace Configurations)](/create-traceconfiguration-utility-network-server) operations contain two new properties:  `useDigitizedDirection` and `synthesizeGeometries`.

- The `useDigitizedDirection` parameter specifies whether the direction of flow will be based on the digitized direction of the line, From global ID and To global ID of the edge object in the association, and the Flow direction attribute.  A new `supportsFlowDirections` capability broadcasts support for this property.

- The `synthesizeGeometries` parameter specifies whether geometries will be inferred and created (synthesized) for associations and edge objects traversed during a trace operation. A new `supportsTraceSynthesizeGeometries` capability broadcasts support for this property.


### Version Management service

The [differences](/differences) operation no longer requires a read session. Additionally, the `sessionId` parameter is now optional.

Organization members must be assigned a license for the [ArcGIS Advanced Editing](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/license-user-type-extensions.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_B75DA80066744473AD5DD1312734654A) user type extension for the following operations:

## 11.1

The updates and changes described below are effective at ArcGIS Enterprise 11.1.

### Feature service

The updates and changes below apply to feature services.

#### General updates

The updates below have been added, in general, for both hosted feature services and nonhosted feature services (referencing enterprise geodatabases) published from ArcGIS Pro:

-    Organization members assigned either the feature service privilege or the default administrator role can now create and manage feature service webhooks using the ArcGIS Server Administrator API. To learn how to create feature service webhooks, see [Create (Webhooks)](DEVSITE/rest/enterprise-administration/server/create-webhook)in the Server Admin API publication. For more information about the types of webhooks that are supported in ArcGIS Enterprise, see [Webhooks in ArcGIS Enterprise](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/about-arcgis-webhooks.htm).
-   Feature services now support 3D object feature layers. The following topics have been added, or updated, to support 3D object feature layers:

    -   [Apply Edits](/apply-edits-feature-service-layer)
    -   [Assets](/fs-assets)
    -   [Cleanup Assets](/fs-cleanup-assets)
    -   [Convert 3D](/fs-convert-3d)
    -   [Has Assets](/fs-has-assets)
    -   [Query 3D](/fs-query-3d)
    -   [Query Assets](/fs-query-assets)
    -   [Upload Assets](/fs-upload-assets)
-    The service- and layer-level `supportedExportFormats`  properties have been expanded to include CSV and GeoJSON as supported formats for exported data.
-   The [`createReplica` ](/create-replica) operation does not require the `geometry`  parameter when the `syncModel`  parameter is set to `none` . This will cause all records to be included for the feature layer unless other filters are set. However, the `geometry`  parameter is required if `syncModel`  values other than `none`  are used.
-    Both the [service-](/apply-edits-feature-service) and [layer-level](/apply-edits-feature-service-layer)`applyEdits`  operations now include the `editsUploadId`  parameter. This parameter references an upload ID from an uploaded file containing service edits and allows you to upload edits to ArcGIS Server and reference them rather than providing the edits in-line with the `edits`  parameter. Support for the new parameter is indicated when the service- and layer-level `supportsApplyEditsbyUploadID`  properties, under `advancedEditingCapabilities` , are set to `true` .

    <Note type={"note"}>

    The service- and layer-level `supportedApplyEditsUploadFormats`  properties, under `advancedEditingCapabilities` , indicate which formats can be used for the edits in the uploaded file.

    </Note>

#### Image Service

- A new property, `storageInfo` , was added that specifies the storage format and packet size of cached map services.

<Note type={"note"}>

The `packetSize`  specifies the number of tiles stored in a bundle. The value for this property is 128 and should not be modified. This value indicates that each bundle covers 128-by-128 tiles. It is only applicable to compact and compactv2 storage formats.

</Note>
#### Enterprise geodatabase data

The updates below have been added for nonhosted feature services (referencing enterprise geodatabases) published from ArcGIS Pro:

-    The `w`  parameter is now supported for qualifying nonhosted feature services. The `w`  parameter returns attachments resized to a pixel width based on the value set for `w` . A nonhosted feature service's support for the `w`  parameter is indicated when the service-level `supportsAttachmentsResizing`  property is set to `true` .
-   Performance improvements have been made when accessing a [`Layer` ](/layer-feature-service) resource with the `returnAdvancedSymbols`  parameter set to `true`  in the request.
-    Controller layer types (such as Parcel Fabric, Topology, Utility Network, and Trace Network layers) can now include sync in their list of capabilities.
-    The `catalogID`  property has been added to the relationships array returned by the [`Relationships` ](/relationships-feature-service) resource. The `catalogID`  property is a universal identifier from the backend data store.
-   Asynchronous requests for the [service-](/apply-edits-feature-service) and [layer-level](/apply-edits-feature-service-layer)`applyEdits`  operations now use a geoprocessing service, which allows for longer running operations.
-    The [`extractChanges` ](/extract-changes-feature-service) operation includes support for the `returnDeletedFeatures`  parameter. This parameter allows you to specify whether the full information for a deleted feature is returned, or only the feature's identifier.

#### Hosted feature services

The updates below have been added, in general, for hosted feature services:

-    A layer's `extent`  property can be updated by an owner or organization administrator using the [`updateDefinition` ](/update-definition-feature-layer) operation with the layer's spatial index.
-    A field's default value is now applied when a row is added with no provided value when using either the `applyEdits`  or `append`  operations.
-    A layer's `allowGeometryUpdates`  property can be updated on a per-layer basis using the [`updateDefinition` ](/update-definition-feature-layer) operation.
-    A service owner or organization administrator can now update a layer's `definitionQuery`  property when running the [`updateDefinition` ](/update-definition-feature-layer) operation.
-    A service's administrative resource now returns a list of supported options for service admin operations (`serviceAdminOperationsOptions`  property) and supported options for layer admin operations (`layerAdminOperationsOptions`  property).
-    A layer's administrative resource now returns a list of supported options for layer admin operations (`layerAdminOperationsOptions`  property).

The updates below have been added to hosted feature services running on a relational data store:

-    Catalog layers can be published as hosted feature services.
-    Both the [service-](/append-feature-service) and [layer-level](/append-feature-service-layer)`append`  operations feature the following enhancements:

    -    The append capability can now be set for qualifying hosted feature services to allow nonservice owners and nonorganization administrators with access to the feature service to run the [`Append` ](/append-feature-service) operation. In earlier releases, the append capability could not be set for hosted feature services, limiting the scope of those who could use the `append`  operation on a given hosted feature service.
    -    The `esriFieldTypeBlob`  field type is now supported.
-    Qualifying hosted feature services now support pagination with the [`queryRelatedRecords` ](/query-related-records-feature-service) operation. Support for pagination is indicated when the layer-level `supportsQueryRelatedPagination`  property, under `advancedQueryCapabilities` , is set to `true` .
-    The [`Relationships` ](/relationships-feature-service) resource is now supported for qualifying hosted feature services. Support for this is indicated when the service-level `supportsRelationshipsResource`  property is set to `true` .

For hosted feature services running on a spatiotemporal data store, the [`queryDateBins` ](/query-date-bins-fsl) operation now supports setting the output boundary field by setting a `binBoundaryAlias`  input property.

#### Cloud Data Warehouse (CDW) feature services

#### General updates

The following general updates have been made for hosted feature services and nonhosted feature services (referencing enterprise geodatabases) published from ArcGIS Pro:

-   The `supportedExportFormats`  property for the feature service and feature service layer resources has been expanded to include `shapefile`  as a supported value.
-   Feature services published for ArcGIS Indoors have the `isIndoorsService`  property set to `true`  included in their service resource.
-    A file geodatabase extracted from a feature service using the [`createReplica` ](/create-replica) operation with the `syncModel`  parameter set to `none`  now includes a GDB_ServiceItems table. This table contains the service and layer resource JSON of the service from which it was generated.

#### Enterprise geodatabase data

The following updates apply to nonhosted feature services (referencing enterprise geodatabase data) published from ArcGIS Pro:

-   The [`extractChanges` ](/extract-changes-feature-service) operation now supports the following changes to its parameters:

    -   A new parameter, `fieldsToCompare`  has been added. This parameter is supported on feature services when the `supportsFieldsToCompare`  service-level property, under `extractChangesCapabilities` , is set to `true` .
    -   Eligible feature services that perform this operation now return an asynchronous response for features, rather than IDs only, when the `returnIdsOnly`  parameter is set to `false` . Support for this is indicated when the `supportsFeatureReturn`  service-level property, under `extractChangesCapabilities` , is set to `true` .
    -   A new parameter, `serverGens`  has been added. This parameter provides the range of `serverGens`  for all layers. This parameter can be used instead of the existing `layerServerGens`  parameter. Support for this parameter is indicated when the `supportsServerGens`  service-level property, under `extractChangesCapabilities` , is set to `true` .
    -   Eligible feature services that perform this operation now return attachment differences when the `returnAttachment`  parameter is set to `true` . Support for attachment differences is indicated when the `supportsReturnAttachments`  service-level property, under `extractChangesCapabilities` , is set to `true` .
-   The [`createReplica` ](/create-replica) operation's `replicaOptions`  parameter's `SyncDataOptions`  accepted property values have been expanded as indicated by the feature service's `supportedSyncDataOptions`  service-level properties listed below:

    -   The `syncDataOptionsIncludeMissingUtilityNetworkLayers`  property is set to `128` . When this property is set along with the `syncDataOptionIncludeUtilityNetworkSystem`  property set to `16` , additional utility network system tables are included.
    -   `syncDataOptionsPreserveTrueCurves`  is set to `256` . When set, the true curves are preserved when taking data offline and syncing.
-   The [`synchronizeReplica` ](/synchronize-replica) operation includes a new parameter, `reconcileBranchVersion` . When it's set to `true` , the replica branch version is automatically reconciled with the default branch on synchronization. This parameter applies to replicas created from branch versioned data when the service has the `versionPerDownloadedMap`  setting.

#### Hosted feature services

The following changes apply to hosted feature services:

-   At ArcGIS Enterprise 10.9.1, the ability to configure a hosted feature service to provide server-side caching was temporarily removed. Response caching is once again supported with the release of Enterprise 11.0. Organizations using Enterprise 10.9, 11.0, or later can cache queries made by services with response caching enabled. Organizations using a 10.9.1 deployment can still use services that support response caching, but queries will not be cached. For more information about enabling response caching on hosted feature service layers, see the [Feature Layer](/feature-layer) topic.
-   Hosted feature services now support setting capabilities on a per-layer basis using the [`updateDefinition` ](/update-definition-feature-layer) administrative operation. Feature layers support this new functionality when the services include the service- and layer-level property, `supportsLayerOverrides` , set to `true` .
-   Both the feature service and feature service layer `applyEdits`  operations support the `async`  parameter. The `async`  parameter is supported when the service- and layer-level `supportsAsyncApplyEdits`  property, under `advancedEditingCapabilities` , is set to `true` .

The following updates apply to hosted feature services running on a relational data store:

-   Hosted feature services now support the `async`  parameter for the [`queryAnalytic` ](/query-analytic) operation. The `async`  parameter is supported when the layer-level `supportsAsync`  property, under `advancedQueryAnalyticCapabilities` , is set to `true` .
-   The `ChangeTracking`  capability can now be enabled on a feature service resource. Adding the `ChangeTracking`  capability exposes the [`extractChanges` ](/extract-changes-feature-service) operation. Having both the `Sync`  and `ChangeTracking`  capabilities enabled at the same time on a hosted feature service is not currently supported.
-   The feature service and feature service layer [`applyEdits` ](/apply-edits-feature-service-layer) operation has a new parameter, `returnEditsResults` . When set to `false` , `applyEdits`  only returns a response of the following form:

    ```javascript
    {"success": <true|false>}
    ```

     The `returnEditsResults`  parameter can be set to `false`  only when the `rollbackOnFailure`  parameter is set to `true` . This new parameter is supported by feature services that have the service- and layer-level `supportsReturnEditResults`  property, under `advancedEditingCapabilities` , set to `true` .

#### CDW feature services

Feature services can now be published from a Google BigQuery data source.

#### Geodata services

-   [Group By Proximity](/group-by-proximity) now includes the `attributeRelationship`  parameter. Use this parameter to define how features are grouped based on a defined attribute relationship. ArcGIS Arcade expressions are supported as input.

### Symbol service

A new service, Symbol service (`SymbolServer` ), was introduced at this release. Symbol service is an ArcGIS Server utility service that provides access to operations to build and generate images for Esri symbols to be used by internal and external web applications. The `SymbolServer`  service provides access to the [`generateImage` ](/generate-image) and [`generateSymbol` ](/generate-symbol) operations, which can be used to generate (extract) images from a 2D or dictionary web style and convert [Scalable Vector Graphics](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/mapping/layer-properties/scalable-vector-graphics-support.htm) (SVG) images to [Cartographic Information Model](https://github.com/Esri/cim-spec) (CIM) symbols, respectively.

### Topographic Production service

The following apply to the topographic product service:

-   The [`delete` ](/tps-delete) operation can delete jobs that have been run or canceled so that they no longer appear in queries or occupy server space.
-   Secured services are supported.
