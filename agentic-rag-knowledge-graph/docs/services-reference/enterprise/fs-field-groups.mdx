## Description

The `fieldGroups`  resource returns the set of field groups that have been defined on a layer. Field groups are required for contingent values and identify the set of fields whose values are constrained by values in the other fields within the group. The field groups returned by this resource could be a superset of the field groups that are used by the contingent value definition, as some field groups may not be used in the context of contingent values.
