## Description

The `uploadAssets`  operation uploads assets to a service either by referencing the upload ID of an asset or having the asset embedded in the request. Assets must be uploaded to a service before they can be referenced in `applyEdits`  or `convert3D`  requests.

If the operation is successful, the response will include the `uploadResults`  property, which will have a result object for each asset included in the request. If an asset is uploaded successfully, the result object will return `success`  as `true`  and the computed hash for the asset. If an asset was not uploaded successfully, the result object will return `success`  as `false`  and an error object that includes an error code and description of the error. If the operation is not successful, the response will return an error.

##  Request parameters

<StyledTable headers={"Parameter,Details"}>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`assets` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

An array of asset objects. Each asset object contains the `assetType`  property and either the `assetData`  or `assetUploadId`  properties, which specify the asset data to be uploaded. For the `assetData`  property, the value is base64 encoded asset data. For the `assetUploadId`  property, the value references an upload ID that's returned after using the [`upload` ](/upload) operation to upload an asset to the server. The list of possible `assetType`  values is configured per feature service and can be obtained from a [feature layer resource's JSON format](/layer-feature-service#json-response-syntax), in the `"infoFor3D": {"editFormats":[]}`  JSON object.

Syntax

```javascript
//General syntax example
assets=[<asset1>, <asset2>]

//assetData syntax example
assets=[{"assetType": "<assetType>","assetData": "<base64EncodedAssetBytes>"}]

//assetUploadId syntax example
assets=[{"assetType": "<assetType>","assetUploadId": "<uploadId>"}]

```

```javascript
assets=[{"assetType": "3D_gltf","assetData": "Z2xURgIAAACoiRAAsFcAAEpTT057ImFjY2Vzc29ycyI6W3siYnVmZmVyVmlldyI6MSwiY29tcG9uZ..."},{"assetType": "IM_png","assetUploadId": "i0bcaf83a-85e2-40a3-b1e7-f80c7b63b832"}]
