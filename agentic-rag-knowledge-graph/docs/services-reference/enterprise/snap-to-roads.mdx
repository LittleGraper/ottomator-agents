description: The Snap to Roads service is designed to snap GPS points to the correct road that was traversed.

## Description

The Snap to Roads service can be used to snap a series of GPS track points to the underlying roads. You can return just the snapped points, or lines representing the roads that were traversed. In addition to the geometry, you can have the service return attributes of the roads like the posted speed limit and length in case you need this to perform route adherence.

For example, the following image shows a series of GPS points that were collected while driving a vehicle. The result shows the points snapped to the underlying roads and the roads that were traversed.

<Note type={"best-practices"}>

The direction of the GPS point shows the compass direction of the vehicle at the time the point was collected. Include this information, along with the speed and accuracy of the point, to improve the quality of the snapping.

## How to use the service

To use the snap to roads service, you need to pass in a set of point features to which you want to snap to roads. In addition to the point geometry, you can include additional GPS-related data to better guide the snapping. You can also specify if you want to return attributes from the underlying roads and if you want to add them on the output points or lines returned.

Below is an example of a request to the Snap to Roads service and a few sample responses:

## Required parameters

### points

<p class="space-x-2"><span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">type:</span><a class="font-sm text-color-3" href="../routing-data-types#feature">feature</a></span><span class="font-bold text-[#a82b1e]">Required</span></p>

Specify the points that you want to snap to the road the vehicle is most likely traveling along. The points can be the GPS points from a navigation device, the tracks captured using [ArcGIS Field Maps](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/field-maps/ios/use-maps/track.htm), or some other set of points that were collected while driving the vehicle.

The distance between the points will affect the performance and final quality of the output. If the points are close together, the algorithm will have a better chance of deducing the probable roads at the expense of processing time. Fewer points will process faster, but may result in the route that was deduced potentially taking different roads.

2.  Click **Services** > **Manage Services**.
3.  In the **Manage Services** module, locate **NetworkAnalysisSync geoprocessing service** and click **Edit Service**.

    If you don't see the service under the **Routing** folder, it may be located within another folder under the **Site (root) >**.
4.  Click the **Parameters** option and change the limit for the number of records returned by the service by editing the value in **Maximum Number of Records Returned by Server** text box.
5.  Click the **Pooling** option and change the maximum time the service can be used by editing the value in the **The maximum time a client can use a service** text box.
6.  Click **Save and Restart** to apply your edits and restart the service.
