Tasks in the `RasterAnalysisTools`  service execute asynchronously, meaning that you submit a request (or job) and poll the service for the status. When the status is `esriJobSucceeded` , you can access the results of the task. When you submit a request, the `RasterAnalysisTools`  service returns to you a unique job ID for the transaction.

_Syntax_: 

```javascript
https://<server url>/arcgis/rest/services/System/RasterAnalysisTools/GPServer/<task name>/jobs/<jobId>
```

 

For example, with a server named `myserver`  on `esri.com`  and a Web Adaptor called `server`  that was running **CalculateDensity** and the job ID returned was `jbe5013b63142432dac207dcff51b68ds` , the URL for checking the job status would be `https://myserver.esri.com/server/rest/services/System/RasterAnalysisTools/GPServer/CalculateDensity/jobs/jbe5013b63142432dac207dcff51b68ds` .

## JobID

You can use the job ID to periodically check the status of the job and messages. Additionally, if the job has successfully completed, you can use the job ID to retrieve the results.

### `jobStatus`  values

The `jobStatus`  property can have the following values:

-   `esriJobSubmitted` 
-   `esriJobWaiting` 
-   `esriJobExecuting` 
-   `esriJobSucceeded` 
-   `esriJobFailed` 
-   `esriJobTimedOut` 
-   `esriJobCancelling` 
-   `esriJobCancelled`
