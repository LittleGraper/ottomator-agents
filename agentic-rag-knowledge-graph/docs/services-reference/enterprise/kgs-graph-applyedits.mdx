## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

<GUID_01CB5051_FA79_42A9_8275_EF008F2C3097_GUID_499B73EC_3D4E_46D2_863A_4534FAF79AA3 />

</Note>

The `applyedits`  operation is performed on a [knowledge graph service's graph resource](/kgs-graph). This operation allows you to add, delete, and update entities and relationships in the knowledge graph, and change their property values. 

The user must have [sufficient privileges to edit content](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/roles.htm) and editing must be enabled for the knowledge graph service for this operation to be successful. Editing can be enabled for a knowledge graph service in the same manner that you [enable it for a hosted feature layer](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/manage-hosted-feature-layers.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_030A9819DFF7498E9DFCDE6030E5FFBA).

##  Requests and responses

This operation can only be performed by sending a PBF-formatted request and receiving a PBF-formatted response. Details of the request and response parameters are provided in the appropriate `.proto`  files.

## PBF Request

Create a PBF-formatted request to perform this operation based on the [`ApplyEditsRequest.proto`  file](https://links.esri.com/KGServer_applyEditsRequestProto).

## PBF Response

Create a PBF-formatted response to get feedback from the operation based on the [`ApplyEditsResponse.proto`  file](https://links.esri.com/KGServer_applyEditsResponseProto).
