## Description

The `queryDateBins`  operation is performed on a [feature service layer resource](/layer-feature-service). This operation returns a histogram of features divided into bins based on a date field. The response can include statistical aggregations for each bin, such as a count or sum, and may also include the aggregate geometries (in other words, centroid) for point layers.

The parameters define the bins, the aggregate information returned, and the included features. Bins are defined using the bin parameter. The `outStatistics`  and `returnCentroid`  parameters define the information each bin will provide. Included features can be specified by providing a `time`  extent, `where`  condition, and a spatial filter, similar to a query operation.

The contents of the `bin`  parameter provide flexibility for defining bin boundaries. The `bin`  parameter's `unit`  property defines the time width of each bin, such as one year, quarter, month, day, or hour. Fixed bins can use multiple units for these time widths. The `offset`  property defines an offset within that time unit. For example, if your bin unit is `day` , and you want bin boundaries to go from noon to noon on the next day, the offset would be 12 hours.

Features can be manipulated with the `time` , `where` , and `geometry`  parameters. By default, the result will expand to fit the feature's earliest and latest point of time. The `time`  parameter defines a fixed starting point and ending point of the features based on the field used in `binField` . The `where`  and `geometry`  parameters allow additional filters to be put on the data.

This operation is only supported on feature services using a spatiotemporal data store. As well, the service property `supportsQueryDateBins`  must be set to `true` .

To use pagination with aggregated queries on hosted feature services in ArcGIS Enterprise, the `supportsPaginationOnAggregatedQueries`  property must be `true`  on the layer. Hosted feature services using a spatiotemporal data store do not currently support pagination on aggregated queries.

## New at 11.1

The `queryDateBins`  operation allows you to set the name of the output `boundary`  field by setting a `binBoundaryAlias`  input property.

##  Request parameters

<StyledTable headers={"Parameter,Details"}>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`binField` 

(Required)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The date field used to determine which bin each feature falls into.

Syntax

```javascript
binField=<dateField>
```

 

Example

```javascript
binField=birthdate
```

 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`bin` 

(Required)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

A JSON parameter that describes the characteristics of the bins, such as the size of the bin and its starting position. The size of each bin is determined by the number of time units denoted by the `number`  and `unit`  properties.

The starting position of the bin is the earliest moment in the specified unit. For example, each year begins at midnight of January 1. An offset inside the bin parameter can provide an offset to the starting position of the bin. This can contain a positive or negative integer value.

A bin can take two forms: either a calendar bin or a fixed bin. A calendar bin is aware of calendar-specific adjustments, such as daylight saving time and leap seconds. Fixed bins are, by contrast, always a specific unit of measurement (for example, 60 seconds in a minute, 24 hours in a day) regardless of where the date and time of the bin starts. For this reason, some calendar-specific units are only supported as calendar bins.

The `timezone`  property will convert the bin ranges into the given time zone. Time zones are provided as IANA strings.

The `offset`  and `timezone`  properties are optional. If `timezone`  is not provided, the default UTC zone is used.

<Note type={"note"}>

The number of units in a calendar bin is always one.

</Note>

Syntax

```javascript
//Calendar Bin syntax
{
  "calendarBin": {
    "unit": "<minute | hour | day | week | month | quarter | year>",
    "timezone": "<IANA Timezone description>",
    "offset": {
      "number": <integer>,
      "unit": "<second | minute | hour | day>"
    }
  }
}

//Fixed Bin syntax
{
  "fixedBin": {
    "unit": "<second | minute | hour | day>",
    "number": "<integer>",
    "offset": {
      "number": <integer>,
      "unit": "<second | minute | hour | day>"
    }
  }
}
```

 

Examples

```javascript
//Calendar Bin example
{
  "calendarBin": {
    "unit": "year",
    "timezone": "US/Arizona",
    "offset": {
      "number": 5,
      "unit": "hour"
    }
  }
}

//Fixed Bin example
{
  "fixedBin": {
    "number": 12,
    "unit": "hour",
    "offset": {
      "number": 5,
      "unit": "hour"
    }
  }
}
```

 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`time` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Defines the beginning and end of the data in `binField`  as epoch milliseconds. This acts as both a filter on the results (in addition to any other filters you apply) and as a strict designation of the first and last points of data, even if there are no data points present at those points.

If the first or last bin does not fall evenly into the division of data, the bin will contain data that is cropped to the time extent. For example, if you have yearly bins from January to December, but the data is defined to be from July to July, the first and last bins will show as a full year but contain only six months of data.

If no time is specified, the range of data encompasses the earliest and latest data points.

Syntax

```javascript
time=<startTime>, <endTime>
```

 

Example

```javascript
//1 January 2008 00:00:00 GMT to 1 January 2009 00:00:00 GMT
time=1199145600000, 1230768000000 

```

 

A `null`  value specified for either the start or end time will represent infinity.

Example

```javascript
time=null, 1230768000000
```

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`binOrder` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Results can be returned in ascending or descending order. The default is ascending (`ASC` ).

Syntax

```javascript
binOrder=<ASC | DESC>
```

 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`outStatistics` 

(Required)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The definitions for one or more field-based statistics to be calculated.

<Note type={"note"}>

If the `outStatisticsFieldName`  property is empty or missing, the map server assigns a field name to the returned statistic field. A valid field name can only contain alphanumeric characters and an underscore. If the `outStatisticsFieldName`  is a reserved keyword of the underlying DBMS, the operation can fail. If this happens, try specifying an alternative `outStatisticFieldName` .

</Note>

Syntax

```javascript
outStatistics=[
  {
    "statisticType": "<count | sum | min | max | avg | stddev | var>",
    "onStatisticField": "Field1", 
    "outStatisticFieldName": "Out_Field_Name1"

  {
    "statisticType": "<count | sum | min | max | avg | stddev | var>",
    "onStatisticField": "Field2",
    "outStatisticFieldName": "Out_Field_Name2"
  }

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`where` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

A WHERE clause for the query filter.

SQL-92 WHERE clause syntax on the fields in the layer is supported for most data sources. Some data sources have restrictions on what is supported. Hosted feature services in ArcGIS Enterprise running on a spatiotemporal data source only support a subset of SQL-92. For example, spatiotemporal-based feature services support the `like`  operator but do not support the `not like`  operator or field equivalency expressions such as `field1 = field2` . The following is a list of supported SQL-92 with spatiotemporal-based feature services:

```javascript
( '<=' | '>=' | '<' | '>' | '=' | '!=' | '<>' | LIKE )
(AND | OR)
(IS | IS_NOT)
(IN | NOT_IN) ( '(' ( expr ( ',' expr )* )? ')' )
COLUMN_NAME BETWEEN LITERAL_VALUE AND LITERAL_VALUE

```

 

For information on how to format time and date information, see the [Date-time queries section](/query-date-bins-fsl#date-time-queries).

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`geometry` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The geometry to apply as the spatial filter. The structure of the geometry is the same as the structure of the JSON geometry objects returned by ArcGIS REST API. In addition to the JSON structures, you can specify the geometry of envelopes and points with a simple comma-separated syntax.

Syntax

```javascript
//JSON structures
geometryType=<geometryType>&geometry={ geometry}

//Envelope simple syntax
geometryType=esriGeometryEnvelope&geometry=<xmin>,<ymin>,<xmax>,<ymax>

//Point simple syntax

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`inSR` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The spatial reference of the input geometry. The spatial reference can be specified as either a well-known ID or as a [spatial reference JSON object](/geometry-objects). If the `inSR`  is not specified, the geometry is assumed to be in the spatial reference of the layer.

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The spatial reference of the returned geometry. The spatial reference can be specified as either a well-known ID or as a [spatial reference JSON object](/geometry-objects). If `outSR`  is not specified, the geometry is returned in the spatial reference of the map.

When using `outSR`  with the `pbf`  output format, the `pbf`  format will use coordinate quantization for layer queries. When an output spatial reference is not provided for a query operation, the feature service derives coordinate quantization parameters from the layer's spatial reference. If the precision in the layer's spatial reference is inadequate for the client applicant's use, it should pass in a spatial reference with suitable precision as the output spatial reference. If the layer's source spatial reference has the desired precision and it is suitable for the client's use, the client can use the source layer's spatial reference as the output spatial reference.

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`spatialRel` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

### Date-time queries

#### Time zone properties

The `dateFieldsTimeReference`  property of the feature service identifies the time zone in which all dates are stored. Both relational and spatiotemporal hosted feature service dates are always stored in UTC.

#### Date and time format

The `INTERVAL`  syntax can be used in place of the date-time queries and is standardized across all map and feature services. The [INTERVAL](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-enterprise/data-management/querying-feature-services-date-time-queries/)  syntax can be used to specify either the current date or timestamp in the query:

```javascript
//Date
<DateField> >= CURRENT_DATE -+ INTERVAL '<IntervalValue>' <TimeStampFormat>

//Timestamp
<DateField> >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -+ INTERVAL '<IntervalValue>' <TimeStampFormat>

```

 

For the syntax demonstrated above, you can interchange the `CURRENT_DATE`  and `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`  values. Both can be used with `+`  or `-`  of `INTERVAL`  values.

<Note type={"note"}>

For both relational and spatiotemporal hosted feature services, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`  will always pass and return the date and time in UTC. Values are also always stored in UTC.

</Note>

The examples below outline the different ways in which the INTERVAL syntax can be modified for the purposes of your query:

```javascript
//'DD' Day
<DateField> >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -+ INTERVAL 'DD' DAY

//'HH' Hour
<DateField> >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -+ INTERVAL 'HH' HOUR

//'MI' Minute
<DateField> >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -+ INTERVAL 'MI' MINUTE

//'SS(.FFF)' Second
<DateField> >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -+ INTERVAL 'SS(.FFF)' SECOND

//'DD HH' DAY TO HOUR
<DateField> >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -+ INTERVAL 'DD HH' DAY TO HOUR

//'DD HH:MI' DAY TO MINUTE
<DateField> >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -+ INTERVAL 'DD HH:MI' DTY TO MINUTE

//'DD HH:MI:SS(.FFF)' DAY TO SECOND
<DateField> >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -+ INTERVAL 'DD HH:MI:SS(.FFF)' DAY TO SECOND

//'HH:MI' HOUR TO MINUTE
<DateField> >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -+ INTERVAL 'HH:MI' HOUR TO MINUTE

//'HH:SS(.FFF)' HOUR TO SECOND
<DateField> >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -+ INTERVAL 'HH:SS(.FFF)' HOUR TO SECOND

//'MI:SS(.FFF)' MINUTE TO SECOND
<DateField> >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -+ INTERVAL 'MI:SS(.FFF)' MINUTE TO SECOND

```

 

<Note type={"note"}>

There are some additional considerations. Except for the second (`.FFF` ) value, all values must be integers. If a date field is specified in the `outFields`  list, the date-time will always be returned in formatted UTC.

</Note>

To demonstrate the `INTERVAL`  format, the example below uses the INTERVAL syntax to query data gathered over the 3 days, 5 hours, 32 minutes, and 28 seconds:

```javascript
DateField >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '3 05:32:28' DAY TO SECOND

```

 

### Quantization parameters JSON properties

The following table outlines the JSON properties for the `quantizationParameters`  JSON object:

<StyledTable headers={"Property,Description"}>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`extent` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

An extent defining the quantization grid bounds. Its [spatialReference](/geometry-objects) matches the input geometry spatial reference if one is specified for the query. Otherwise, the extent will be in the layer's spatial reference.

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`mode` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Geometry coordinates are optimized for viewing and displaying of data. The view value specifies that geometry coordinates should be optimized for viewing and displaying of data. The edit value specifies that full-resolution geometries should be returned, which can support lossless editing.

<Note type={"note"}>

The edit value can only be used when the `supportsQuantizationEditMode`  layer property is `true` .

</Note>

Value: `view`  \| `edit` 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`originPosition` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Integer coordinates will be returned relative to the origin position defined by this property value. The default value is `upperLeft` .

Values: `upperLeft`  \| `lowerLeft` 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`tolerance` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The tolerance is the size of one pixel in the [outSpatialReference](/geometry-objects)  units. This number is used to convert the coordinates to integers by building a grid with resolution matching the tolerance. Each coordinate is then snapped to one pixel on the grid. Consecutive coordinates snapped to the same pixel are removed to reduce the overall response size. 

The units of `tolerance`  are defined by outSpatialReference. If the `outSpatialReference`  is not specified, tolerance is assumed to be in the unit of the spatial reference of the layer. If the tolerance is not specified, the [maxAllowableOffset](/query-related-records-feature-service-layer)  is used.

<Note type={"note"}>

If the tolerance and [maxAllowableOffset](/query-related-records-feature-service-layer) are not specified, a default 10,000 by 10,000 grid is used.

</Note>

If `mode`  is set to `edit` , the `tolerance`  is always set to the full-resolution tolerance of the spatial reference regardless of what is passed in or set for the `maxAllowableOffset` . If `mode`  is set to `view`  and the `tolerance`  and [maxAllowableOffset](/query-related-records-feature-service) are not specified, a default 10,000 by 10,000 grid is used.

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

</StyledTable>

## Example usage

The following examples demonstrate two ways to modify the features returned by the `queryDateBins`  operation.

### Example one

Suppose you want to do a daily breakdown of sales for the month of January 2021. You'd like to define your days as starting at 8:00 am `America/Log_Angeles`  time.

You'd start by defining the bins. You want a breakdown along calendar days, so you'll use a calendar bin with the unit type `day` . By default, daily bins start at 00:00:00 UTC. To get the bins, you want to define your time zone as `America/Log_Angeles`  and shift the time forward 8 hours by providing an offset. This gives you the bin definition.

```javascript
bin={
  "calendarBin": {
    "unit": "day",
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
    "offset": {
      "number": 8,
      "unit": "hour"
    }
  }
}
```

 

Since you're looking at sales, you'll use the `dateSold`  field as the bin field:

```javascript
binField=dateSold
```

 

You're not sure that the data stretches across every day of the month. The last two days fall on a weekend, and the stores are only open on weekdays. If you only have data to the January 29, you could miss the last two days from appearing in the result, but you would instead like those to show up as days with zero sales. To ensure that all days in January are displayed, as well as restricting the included features to only January (and to 7:59 am on February 1), you can define a time extent on the data from January 1 at 8:00 a.m. to February 1 at 7:59:59:9999 a.m.:

```javascript
time=1609516800000, 1612195199999
```

 

Note that if you wish to restrict the days to January, but to not include the last two days, you can use the `where`  parameter.

You can define what information is returned using the statistics parameters. For analysis, you're interested in seeing the counts and averages of the data. This will return the count of items and the average sales price:

```javascript
outStatistics=[
  {
    "statisticType": "count",
    "onStatisticField": "objectid",
    "outStatisticFieldName": "item_sold_count"
  },
  {
    "statisticType": "avg",
    "onStatisticField": "price",
    "outStatisticFieldName": "avg_daily_revenue"
  }
]
```

 

Now you have the basics of your result the way you want it. You can further refine results by providing filters on the data, such as filtering certain products using a where filter, or using spatial filters to look at regional data.

#### Example URL

The following is a sample request URL for the workflow discussed above:

```javascript
https://machine.domain.com/webadaptor/rest/services/Hosted/Sales21/FeatureServer/0/queryDateBins?binField= dateSold& bin={"calendarBin": {"unit": "day","timezone": "America/Los_Angeles","offset": {"number": 8,"unit": "hour"}}}& outStatistics=[{"statisticType": "count","onStatisticField": "objectid","outStatisticFieldName": "item_sold_count"},{"statisticType": "avg","onStatisticField": "price","outStatisticFieldName": "avg_daily_revenue "}]&where=& time=1609516800000, 1612195199999&binOrder=&geometry=&inSR=&outSR=&spatialRel=esriSpatialRelIntersects&returnCentroid=false&quantizationParameters=&resultOffset=&resultRecordCount=&returnExceededLimitFeatures=false&f=pjson
```

 

#### JSON Response example

The following JSON response is a sample of the information returned from the request:

```javascript
{
  "features": [
    {
      "attributes": {
        "boundary": 1609516800000,
        "avg_daily_revenue": 300.40,
        "item_sold_count": 79
      }
    },

### Example two

You want to create yearly bins for Arizona temperature data, beginning from 1/1/1976 and ending on the final date contained in the record data, starting at 5:00 a.m. You want to include only data that contains a temperature reading for each year together with the centroid. To achieve this, the following information is included in your request:

```javascript
binField=recorded_date

bin={
  "calendarBin": {
    "unit": "year",
    "timezone": "America/Phoenix",
    "offset": {
      "number": 5,
      "unit": "hour"
    }
  }
}

outStatistics=[
  {
    "statisticType": "count",
    "onStatisticField": "temperature",
    "outStatisticFieldName": "results_count"
  },
  {
    "statisticType": "avg",
    "onStatisticField": "temperature",
    "outStatisticFieldName": "temperature_avg"
  }
]

where=temperature is not null


time=189331200000, null

returnCentroid=true

```

 

#### Example URL

The following is a sample request URL for the workflow discussed above:

```javascript
https://machine.domain.com/webadaptor/rest/services/Hosted/AZTempRec/0/ queryDateBins? binField=recorded_date& bin={"calendarBin": {"unit": "year","timezone": "America/Phoenix","offset": {"number": 5,"unit": "hour"}}}& outStatistics=[{"statisticType": "count","onStatisticField": "temperature","outStatisticFieldName": "results_count"},{"statisticType": "avg","onStatisticField": "temperature","outStatisticFieldName": "temperature_avg"}]&where=temperature is not null& time=189331200000, null&binOrder=&geometry=&inSR=&outSR=&spatialRel=esriSpatialRelIntersects&returnCentroid=true&quantizationParameters=&resultOffset=&resultRecordCount=&returnExceededLimitFeatures=false&f=pjson
```

 

#### JSON Response example

The following JSON response is a sample of the information returned from the request:
