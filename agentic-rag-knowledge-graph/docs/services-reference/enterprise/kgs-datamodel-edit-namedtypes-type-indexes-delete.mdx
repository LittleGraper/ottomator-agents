## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

<GUID_01CB5051_FA79_42A9_8275_EF008F2C3097_GUID_499B73EC_3D4E_46D2_863A_4534FAF79AA3 />

</Note>

The `delete`  operation is available for the [indexes resource](/kgs-datamodel-edit-namedtypes-type-indexes) associated with a named type in a knowledge graph service's data model. With this operation, you can delete an index from a field or from multiple fields associated with an entity type or relationship type in the data model. Deleting an index will prevent you from searching content stored in the associated fields using the [search](/kgs-graph-search) operation on the knowledge graph service's graph resource.

Identify the specific [type](/kgs-datamodel-edit-namedtypes-type) whose indexes you want to modify by specifying the type name. Use the data model [query](/kgs-datamodel-query) operation to learn about the item types that are defined in the schema and the fields already defined for that type.

You must have [sufficient privileges to edit content](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/roles.htm) and editing must be enabled for the knowledge graph service for this operation to be successful. You can enable editing for a knowledge graph service in the same way that you [enable it for a hosted feature layer](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/manage-hosted-feature-layers.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_030A9819DFF7498E9DFCDE6030E5FFBA). The knowledge graph service's `strict`  property must not be set to true, which indicates the data model cannot be modified.

##  Requests and responses

This operation can only be performed by sending a Protocolbuffer Binary Format (PBF)-formatted request and receiving a PBF-formatted response. Details of the request and response parameters are provided in the appropriate `.proto`  files.

## PBF request

Create a PBF-formatted request to perform this operation based on the [`DeleteIndexesRequest.proto`  file](https://links.esri.com/KGServer_deleteIndexesRequestProto). 

## PBF response

Create a PBF-formatted response to get feedback from the operation based on the [`DeleteIndexesResponse.proto`  file](https://links.esri.com/KGServer_deleteIndexesResponseProto).
