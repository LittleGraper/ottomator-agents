## Description

The `deleteFromDefinition`  operation supports deleting a definition property in a feature service layer. The result of this operation is a response indicating success or failure with error code and description.

## New at 11.4

- This operation now supports performing asynchronous requests for ArcGIS Enterprise hosted feature services.
- This operation can delete full text search indexes for hosted feature services. Deleting a full text search index is performed in the same way as deleting regular field indexes.
- This operation can delete the subtypes of a hosted feature service layer.

## Example usage

[ Example one: Delete fields from feature service layer](/delete-from-definition-feature-layer#example-one-delete-fields-from-a-feature-service-layer)

[ Example two: Delete indexes from feature service layer](/delete-from-definition-feature-layer#example-two-delete-indexes-from-a-feature-service-layer)

[ Example three: Delete subtype code from a feature layer](#example-three-delete-subtype-code-from-a-feature-layer)

### Example one: Delete fields from a feature service layer

Below is a sample URL used to access the `deleteFromDefinition`  operation:

```javascript
https://services.myserver.com/OrgID/ArcGIS/rest/admin/services/example1/FeatureServer/0/deleteFromDefinition
```

 

Example input for the `deleteFromDefinition`  parameter:

```javascript
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "GlobalID"
    },
    {
      "name": "date1"
    },
    {   
      "name": "str2"
    }
  ]
} 
```

 

### Example two: Delete indexes from a feature service layer

Below is a sample URL used to access the `deleteFromDefinition`  operation:

```javascript
https://services.myserver.com/OrgID/ArcGIS/rest/admin/services/example2/FeatureServer/0/deleteFromDefinition
```

 

Example input for the `deleteFromDefinition`  parameter:

```javascript
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "name": "index1"
    },
    {
      "name": "index2" 
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example three: Delete subtype code from a feature layer

Below is a sample URL used to access the `deleteFromDefinition`  operation:

```javascript
https://services.myserver.com/OrgID/ArcGIS/rest/admin/services/example1/FeatureServer/0/deleteFromDefinition
```

Example input for the `deleteFromDefinition` parameter. Only the subtype code is required:

```other
{
  "subtypes": [
    {
      "code": 4
    }
  ]
}

```
 

## JSON Response syntax

The example below reflects the syntax of a synchronous response:

```other
{
  "success": <true|false>,
  "error": {
    "code": <code>,
    "message": "<description>",
    "details": [
      "<message>"
    ]
  }
}
```

The example below reflects the syntax of an asynchronous response:

<Note>

Asynchronous responses may return `statusURL` as `statusUrl`.

</Note>

```other
{"statusURL": “<response status URL>”}

```


## JSON Response examples

### Synchronous responses

When `deleteFromDefinition` succeeds as a synchronous response:

```other
{
  "success": true
}
```

When `deleteFromDefinition` fails as a synchronous response:

```other
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400, 
    "message": "", 
    "details": [
      "Unable to update feature service layer definition."
    ]
  }
}
```

### Asynchronous responses

When an `deleteFromDefinition` request is submitted asynchronously, the response will include a `statusURL`, the value of which is a URL that can be accessed to check the `status` of the request:

```other
{
  "statusURL": "https://machine.domain.com/ArcGIS/rest/admin/services/myhostedservice/FeatureServer/0/deleteFromDefinition/5f4f34c6-2bcf-41c7-8bd1-ea777570ad23"
}

```
The URL can be used to periodically check the progress of the request, which is returned as the `status` property. When the job completes, the response retrieved from the status URL will indicate whether the request completed successfully.

<Note>

The casing for success or failure messages may vary from what is shown below:

- When jobs are completed successfully, the status in the response will either return as `Completed` or `COMPLETED`.
- When jobs are completed  with errors, the status in the response will either return as `Failed` or `FAILED`.
- If a job fails, the resposne will include error details in either an `error` or `errorMessage` JSON object.

Other status values may be returned while the operation is processing. For example, `Pending` may be returned as a status. Additional, optional properties may also be included in the response, such as `submissionTime` and `lastUpdatedTime`.

</Note>

```other
//success

{
  "submissionTime":1726444564500,
  "lastUpdatedTime":1726444568893,
  "status":"Completed"
}

//failure

{
  "submissionTime": 1726520769240,
  "lastUpdatedTime": 1726520769773,
  "status": "Failed",
  "error": {
    "code": 500,
    "description": "Editing definition error - RCPerfTestOneWayAllRowsParent.DBO.Volcano_Roop "
  }
}


```
