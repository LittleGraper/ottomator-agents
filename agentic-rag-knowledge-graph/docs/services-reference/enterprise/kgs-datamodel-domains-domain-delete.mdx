## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

<GUID_01CB5051_FA79_42A9_8275_EF008F2C3097_GUID_499B73EC_3D4E_46D2_863A_4534FAF79AA3 />

</Note>

The `delete`  operation is available for a knowledge graph service data model's [domains resource](/kgs-datamodel-domains). With this operation, you can delete a domain from the data model. Identify the [domain](/kgs-datamodel-domains-domain) you want to delete by specifying the domain name. Use the data model [query](/kgs-datamodel-query) operation to learn about the domains that are defined in the schema.

You must have [sufficient privileges to edit content](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/roles.htm) and editing must be enabled for the knowledge graph service for this operation to be successful. You can enable editing for a knowledge graph service in the same way that you [enable it for a hosted feature layer](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/manage-hosted-feature-layers.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_030A9819DFF7498E9DFCDE6030E5FFBA). The knowledge graph service's `strict`  property must not be set to true, which indicates the data model cannot be modified.

##  Requests and responses

This operation can only be performed by sending an HTTP POST request and receiving a Protocolbuffer Binary Format (PBF)-formatted response. Details of the response parameters are provided in the appropriate `.proto`  file.

## Example usage

The following is a sample POST request to delete a domain named `WarehouseType` :

```javascript
POST /webadaptor/rest/services/Hosted/SupplyChain/KnowledgeGraphServer/dataModel/domains/WarehouseType/delete HTTP/1.1
Host: machine.domain.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: []

```

 

## PBF response

Create a PBF-formatted response to get feedback from the operation based on the [`DeleteDomainResponse.proto`  file](https://links.esri.com/KGServer_deleteDomainResponseProto).
