Raster Analysis tasks that have the `mask`  property in their `context`  parameter will only consider those cells that fall within the analysis mask in the operation for the output raster.

Mask syntax

```other
{"mask": {
  "url": "https://<servername.domain.com>/arcgis/rest/services/<servicename>/ImageServer"}
}
```

 

There is no mask specified by default. The mask can be a raster or a feature dataset. If the analysis mask is a raster, all cells that have a value will be considered to define the mask. Cells in a mask raster that are NoData will be considered to be outside the mask and will be NoData in the output. If the analysis mask is a feature dataset, it will internally be converted to a raster on execution. For this reason, you should ensure that the [Cell Size](/cell-size) and [Snap Raster](/snap-raster) are set appropriately for your analysis.
