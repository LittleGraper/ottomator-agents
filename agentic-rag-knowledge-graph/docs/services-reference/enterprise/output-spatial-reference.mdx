Raster Analysis tasks that have the `outSR`  property in their `Context`  parameter will save results in the specified spatial reference.

Spatial Reference syntax:

```other
"outSR": {"wkid": <wkid>}
```

 

The spatial reference is specified with a WKID (well-known ID). Each WKID number is unique to a specific spatial reference. For a list of all the WKID numbers and their corresponding spatial references, see [Using spatial references](/using-spatial-references).

Spatial Reference example (GCS_WGS_1984)

```other
"outSR": {"wkid": 4326}
```
