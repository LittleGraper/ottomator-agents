## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

<GUID_01CB5051_FA79_42A9_8275_EF008F2C3097_GUID_499B73EC_3D4E_46D2_863A_4534FAF79AA3 />

</Note>

The `add`  operation is available to modify the [domains resource](/kgs-datamodel-domains) associated with a knowledge graph service's data model. You can add a domain that can later be used to define the content that can be provided in a property for an entity type or a relationship type in the data model.

The user must have [sufficient privileges to edit content](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/roles.htm) and editing must be enabled for the knowledge graph service for this operation to be successful. Editing can be enabled for a knowledge graph service in the same manner that you [enable it for a hosted feature layer](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/manage-hosted-feature-layers.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_030A9819DFF7498E9DFCDE6030E5FFBA). The knowledge graph service's `strict`  property must not be set to true, which indicates the data model cannot be modified.

##  Requests and responses
