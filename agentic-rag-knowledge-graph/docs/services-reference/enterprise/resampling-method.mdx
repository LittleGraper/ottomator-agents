Raster analysis tasks that have the `resamplingMethod`  property set in the `context`  parameter use the specified resampling method when you're transforming your raster dataset.

The `resamplingMethod`  property has three options.

-   ResamplingMethod (`resamplingMethod` )—Choose the resampling method to use when creating the raster dataset for download.

    -   `NEAREST` —Uses the value of the closest cell to assign a value to the output cell when resampling. This is the default.
    -   `BILINEAR` —Determines the new value of a cell based on a weighted distance average of the four nearest input cell centers.
    -   `CUBIC` —Determines the new value of a cell based on fitting a smooth curve through the 16 nearest input cell centers.

Resampling Method syntax for image resampling:

```other
{"resamplingMethod": "BILINEAR"}
```
