## Description

The `updateDefinition`  operation supports updating a definition property in a hosted feature service. The result of this operation is a response indicating success or failure with an error code and a description.

## New at 11.4

This operation now supports performing asynchronous requests for ArcGIS Enterprise hosted feature services.

## Example usage

```javascript
https://services.myserver.com/OrgID/ArcGIS/rest/admin/services/example/FeatureServer/updateDefinition
```

 

### Example one: Enable editor tracking and ownership access control in a feature service

The example below is a sample JSON object for the `updateDefinition`  parameter that demonstrates how to enable editor tracking and ownership access control in a feature service. The following request is formatted for readability:

```javascript
{
  "editorTrackingInfo": {
    "enableEditorTracking": true,
    "enableOwnershipAccessControl": true,
    "allowOthersToUpdate": true,
    "allowOthersToDelete": false
  }
}
```

 

### Example two: Update feature service capability

The following example is a sample JSON object for the `updateDefinition`  parameter that demonstrates how to update the feature service's capabilities:

```javascript
{"capabilities":"Create,Query"}
```

 

### Example three: Enable feature service sync

The following example is a sample JSON object for the `updateDefinition`  parameter that demonstrates how to enable sync on a feature service:

```javascript
{"syncEnabled": true}
```

 

### Example four: Update feature service properties

The example below is a sample JSON object for the `updateDefinition`  parameter that demonstrates how to update a feature service's properties. The following request is formatted for readability:

```javascript
{
  "name": "SanFrancisco2", 
  "hasStaticData": false, 
  "allowGeometryUpdates": "true",
  "maxRecordCount": 2000, 
  "serviceDescription": "SanFrancisco2",  
  "description": "",     
  "copyrightText": "",
  "units": "",
  "xssPreventionInfo": {
    "xssPreventionEnabled": true, 
    "xssPreventionRule": "InputOnly", 
    "xssInputRule": "rejectInvalid"
  },   
  "initialExtent": {
    "xmin": -122.514435102,
    "ymin": 5.6843418860808E-14,
    "xmax": 138.625776397,
    "ymax": 67.1577965990001
  }
}
```

 

<Note type={"note"}>

XSS properties are set to define how attribute edits are treated when editing data.

`"xxsPreventionEnabled": <true|false>` —This property is `true`  by default and is used to block attribute edits containing potentially harmful content. If it's set to `false` , no attempt will be made to block potentially harmful content. You can optionally fine tune this behavior with the following xss properties:

-   `"xssPreventionRule": <input|inputOutput>` —If it's set to `input` , attributes containing potentially harmful content will be blocked. If it's set to `inputOutput` , attribute edits containing potentially harmful content will be blocked and query results containing potentially harmful content will be encoded.
-   `"xssInputRule": <rejectInvalid|sanitizeInvalid>` —When this is set to `rejectInvalid` , attribute edits containing potentially harmful content will be blocked. When this is set to `sanitizeInvalid` , edits will be encoded, but potentially harmful attribute edits will be allowed.

</Note>

### Example five: Add the preferred time zone property

The example below is a sample JSON object for the `updateDefinition`  parameter that demonstrates how to set the preferred time for a hosted feature service. The preferred time is the time zone the service author recommends clients to work in. Preferred time is used by newer clients, such as ArcGIS Pro 2.7 (and above), which defaults to working with date values in the preferred time reference.

Once the update completes, the feature service resource and all layer resources will have the `preferredTimeReference`  set. To unset `preferredTimeReference` , run `updateDefinition`  with `"timeZone": null` .

<Note type={"note"}>

For a list of all available time zone IDs, see the [Microsoft Time Zone Index Values](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/default-time-zones?view=windows-11) reference page.

</Note>

The following request is formatted for readability:

```javascript
{
  "preferredTimeReference": {
    "timeZone": "Pacific Standard Time",
    "respectsDaylightSaving": true
  }
}
```


### Example six: Update `layerOverridesEnabled` 

In 8.4 feature service will support layer overrides of feature service behavior related to `Capabilities, AllowsGeometryUpdate, OBAC`  . Initial support will be in online feature service. Server and hosted enterprise will follow in later releases. 

<StyledTable headers={"Parameter,Description"}>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`layerOverridesEnabled`

 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Online feature service defaults this property to `true` . It is a service property to indicate if a layer can override service properties related to Capabilities, AllowsGeometryUpdate, and OBAC. The layer can override the service capabilities only if it is supported by the server and `layerOverridesEnabled`  is `true` .

Values: `true(default) | false` 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

</StyledTable>

Sync,ChangeTracking,Append,Extract Capabilities

The above capabilities cannot be overridden in any layer and always follow service capabilities and settings. The feature service guarantees layer capabilities will always follow the feature service as far as the above Capabilities/AllowsGeometryUpdate/OBAC.

Propagate Properties Changes:

The feature service properties (Capabilities, AllowsGeometryUpdate, OBAC) are propagated by default to all layers. If any of the Capabilities, AllowsGeometryUpdate, OBAC are overridden in any layer, then the overridden layer will preserve the overridden properties even if the feature service capabilities changes. New layers added to the feature service will inherit its properties from the feature service. Any changes on the feature service will be propagated to the new layers and the new layers capabilities can be overridden at any time after creation.

supportsLayerOverrides property:

-   `TRUE`  if it is supported by the server.
-   If this property is not returned by the server, it is `FALSE` .
-   Supports property is available on the layer and service metadata.

LayerOverridesEnabled property:

Example

`https://services.myserver.com/OrgID/ArcGIS/rest/services/serviceName/FeatureServer?f=pjson`

 

```javascript
{
  "LayerOverridesEnabled": false
}
```

 

Capabilities

Example

`https://services.myserver.com/OrgID/ArcGIS/rest/admin/services/serviceName/FeatureServer/0/updateDefinition`

 

```javascript
{
  "capabilities": "Create,Update,Delete"
}
```

 

AllowsGeometryUpdates:

Example

`https://services.myserver.com/OrgID/ArcGIS/rest/admin/services/serviceName/FeatureServer/0/updateDefinition`

 

```javascript
{
  "allowGeometryUpdates": true
}
```

 

OBAC:

Example

`https://services.myserver.com/OrgID/ArcGIS/rest/admin/services/serviceName/FeatureServer/0/updateDefinition`

 

```javascript
{"ownershipBasedAccessControlForFeatures" : {

"allowOthersToQuery" : true,

"allowOthersToDelete" : true,

"allowOthersToUpdate" : true,

"allowAnonymousToQuery" : true,

"allowAnonymousToUpdate" : true,

"allowAnonymousToDelete" : true
}

}
```

 

Layer Overrides Metadata:

Layer metadata returns the list of properties that have been overridden on each layer.

Example

`https://services.myserver.com/OrgID/ArcGIS/rest/services/serviceName/FeatureServer/0?f=pjson`

 

```javascript
"layerOverrides" : [

"allowGeometryUpdates",

"capabilities",

"ownershipBasedAccessControl"
]
```

 

## JSON Response syntax

The example below reflects the syntax of a synchronous response:

```other
{
  "success": <true|false>,
  "error": {
    "code": <code>,
    "message": "<description>",
    "details": [
      "<message>"
    ]
  }
}
```

The example below reflects the syntax of an asynchronous response:

<Note>

Asynchronous responses may return `statusURL` as `statusUrl`.

</Note>

```other
{"statusURL": “<response status URL>”}

```


## JSON Response examples

### Synchronous responses

When `updateDefinition` succeeds as a synchronous response:

```other
{
  "success": true
}
```

When `updateDefinition` fails as a synchronous response:

```other
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400, 
    "message": "", 
    "details": [
      "Unable to update feature service layer definition."
    ]
  }
}
```

### Asynchronous responses

When an `updateDefinition` request is submitted asynchronously, the response will include a `statusURL`, the value of which is a URL that can be accessed to check the `status` of the request:

```other
{
  "statusURL": "https://machine.domain.com/ArcGIS/rest/admin/services/myhostedservice/FeatureServer/updateDefinition/5f4f34c6-2bcf-41c7-8bd1-ea777570ad23"
}

```
The URL can be used to periodically check the progress of the request, which is returned as the `status` property. When the job completes, the response retrieved from the status URL will indicate whether the request completed successfully.

<Note>

The casing for success or failure messages may vary from what is shown below:

- When jobs are completed successfully, the status in the response will either return as `Completed` or `COMPLETED`.
- When jobs are completed  with errors, the status in the response will either return as `Failed` or `FAILED`.
- If a job fails, the resposne will include error details in either an `error` or `errorMessage` JSON object.

Other status values may be returned while the operation is processing. For example, `Pending` may be returned as a status. Additional, optional properties may also be included in the response, such as `submissionTime` and `lastUpdatedTime`.

</Note>

```other
//success

{
  "submissionTime":1726444564500,
  "lastUpdatedTime":1726444568893,
  "status":"Completed"
}

//failure

{
  "submissionTime": 1726520769240,
  "lastUpdatedTime": 1726520769773,
  "status": "Failed",
  "error": {
    "code": 500,
    "description": "Editing definition error - RCPerfTestOneWayAllRowsParent.DBO.Volcano_Roop "
  }
}


```
