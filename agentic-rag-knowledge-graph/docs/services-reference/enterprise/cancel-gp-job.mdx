## Description

The `cancel` operation is performed on an asynchronous [`jobs`](/gp-job) resource. This operation results in the cancellation of a running geoprocessing job. You can provide an argument to the `cancel` operation as defined in the following parameters table. The job will have a canceling (`esriJobCancelling`) status with this operation, and a canceled (`esriJobCancelled`) status when the job is canceled.

##  Request parameters

`f`

(Optional)

Description: The response format. The default response format is `html`.

Values: `html`| `json`

</StyledTableCell>
</StyledTableRow>
</StyledTable>

You can cancel a job that is in waiting (`esriJobWaiting`) or running (`esriJobExecuting`) status. Canceling a canceled (`esriJobCancelled`), succeeded (`esriJobSucceeded`), failed (`esriJobFailed`), or timed out (`esriJobTimedOut`) job status will return an `Invalid or missing input parameters` error. If the cancellation request is submitted for a job with a submitted status (`esriJobSumbitted`) before the job starts to run, you will receive the same error, and the job will continue to run.

## Example usage

Cancel the job with an ID of `j8279ff17f3b348ddadb6c092cfb7e7ba` and expecting a JSON response.

```

 

## JSON Response syntax

The syntax of a job cancellation request. The request comes with the `jobId` and a status. Typically, the status will be `esriJobCancelling`.

```json
{
    "jobId" : "<jobId>",
    "jobStatus" : "<jobStatus>"
}
```

 

## JSON Response example

A job with an ID of `j3ba49f5bb25343679c9f20705d643e54` is being cancelled.

```json
{
    "jobId":"j3ba49f5bb25343679c9f20705d643e54",
    "jobStatus":"esriJobCancelling"
}
```
