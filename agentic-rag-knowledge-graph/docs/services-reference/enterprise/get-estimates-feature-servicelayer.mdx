## Description

The `getEstimates`  operation returns up-to-date approximations of layer information, such as row count and extent. Layers that support the `getEstimates`  operation will include an `infoInEstimates`  array property that describes what is supported. For example, layers may list the following for `infoInEstimates`  if they support getting estimates of both count and extent:

```javascript
"infoInEstimates": [
  "extent",
  "count"
],

```

 

Tables may list the following as they do not have features, and therefore extent is not applicable:

```javascript
"infoInEstimates": [
  "count"
],

```

 

The extent is returned as an envelope and may be larger than the exact extent of the data.

Count returns the total row count from the data in the back-end data store. The value returned does not apply any attribute or spatial filters that may be baked into the layer. If the data is archived (`isDataArchived`  is `true` ), the count will be based on the entire archive, not just the live rows. Branch versioned and archived, non-versioned data, are data types that are archived. Traditional versioned layers and tables do not support count.
