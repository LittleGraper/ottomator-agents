## Description

The Topographic Production Service resource represents a topographic production server object extension (SOE). It is the entry point for all functionality related to creating topographic products in ArcGIS Server. This resource provides information about the service and enables the topographic production server capabilities on a map service. You can also view child resources and operations defined by the SOE.

<Note type={"note"}>
At the ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 release, standalone ArcGIS Server deployments are supported. Prior releases require a federated Enterprise portal.

In a standalone deployment with web-tier authentication, the Topographic Production Service can only connect to public services. 

[Learn more about web-tier authentication in ArcGIS Server](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/administer/windows/configuring-arcgis-server-s-authentication-tier.htm)
</Note>

The following operations are supported in the SOE:

- [`addProduct`](/tps-add-product)—Adds a definition of a map product to the service that can be used to generate a map.
- [`calculateExtent`](/tps-calculate-extent)—Calculates a custom area of interest (AOI) for a given product and version.
- [`delete`](/tps-delete)—Deletes jobs that have been run or were canceled so that they no longer appear in queries or occupy server space.
- [`generateProduct`](/tps-generate-product)—Automates the process of producing a layout or map based on an existing map product definition.
- [`removeProduct`](/tps-remove-product)—Removes a map product from the Topographic Production Service.
- [`updateProduct`](/tps-update-product)—Updates the properties of an existing map product.
- [`products`](/tps-products)—Gets the map products that the Topographic Production Service supports.
  - [`product`](/tps-product)—Gets a single map product from the products that the Topographic Production Service supports.
- [`jobs`](/tps-jobs)
  - [`cancel`](/tps-cancel)—Cancels a job submitted through the `generateProduct` REST operation.
  - [`job`](/tps-job)—Tracks the status of a job run by the `generateProduct` REST operation. Returns the status, start date, last modified date, and messages for the job.
  - [`query`](/tps-query)—Tracks the status of jobs run by the `generateProduct` REST operation. Returns the status, start date, last modified date, and messages for a set of jobs.
