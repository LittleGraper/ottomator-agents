## Description

<Note>
The ArcGIS Data Reviewer extension is required to use this resource.
</Note>

<Note>
This resource is dependent on the ArcGIS Data Reviewer ArcMap runtime-based server object extension (SOE). ArcGIS Enterprise 10.9.x, part of the ArcGIS 2021 releases, is the last release of ArcGIS Enterprise to support services published from ArcMap.

Consider Data Reviewer capabilities enabled using ArcGIS Pro and integrated in the [Validation service](/validation-server).
</Note>

Data Reviewer defines a 'result' as a row, or feature, submitted to the Data Reviewer workspace. Data Reviewer exposes a quality control workflow in which a result is reviewed, corrected, and verified. [Lifecycle status](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/extensions/data-reviewer/result-management-of-the-quality-review-process.htm) describes the result's state within the Reviewer quality control workflow.

Lifecycle status has three phases:

-   Review
-   Correction
-   Verification

Results move from **Review** to **Correction** to **Verification**. Each category has different life cycle status values. These lifecycle status values describe how a result was handled within a life cycle phase.

This REST operation retrieves a JSON array of lifecycle status objects. Each array member has a `descriptionType`, `descriptionString` and `descriptionCode`. 

`descriptionString` defines the [lifecycle status string](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/extensions/data-reviewer/result-management-of-the-quality-review-process.htm#GUID-809A4608-D179-4824-B18C-EFACE1090146) for a result. For example, a `descriptionString` of **Exception** indicates that a result's life cycle phase is **Verification** meaning that the result has completed the Data Reviewer quality control workflow. 

`descriptionCode` pertains to a specific [lifecycle status](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/extensions/data-reviewer/result-management-of-the-quality-review-process.htm#TABLE_6DE4ABEFB3FE46E2B49A861FEB4990C2). For example, a `descriptionCode` of 2 means that a result is in **Correction** phase and is yet to be verified. 

ArcGIS Data Reviewer 10.x will return 7 for `descriptionType` for all lifecycle status codes. 

Use this REST operation to retrieve lifecycle status values for use in other REST operations like [WriteResult](/rest-write-result), [WriteFeatureAsResult](/rest-write-feature-as-result), and [updateLifecycleStatus](/rest-update-lifecycle-status).
