The Ortho Mapping service contains a number of tasks that allow you to perform photogrammetric processing and generation of orthoimage mapping products. For the list of available tools, see [Ortho Mapping service tasks](/ortho-mapping-service-tasks).

## Licensing

The administrator of your organization needs to configure Portal for ArcGIS so that the [Raster Analysis server capability is enabled](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/configure-and-deploy-arcgis-enterprise-for-raster-analytics.htm). To use the analysis tasks, the administrator needs to grant you [privileges](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/roles.htm) to **Create, update, and delete** content and **Publish hosted features**. To use Raster Analysis tasks, you also need Publisher privileges.

## Common patterns

The tasks in the Ortho Mapping service all share a common pattern described as follows: 

-   For most tasks, one or more of the input parameters are rasters. These rasters can come from an image service, map service, or in the form of a raster dataset. See [Raster Input](/raster-input) for more information.
-   As described in [Raster Output](/raster-output), all raster analysis tasks create data. How data is returned to you is controlled by the `outputName`  parameter.
-   All tasks have a `context`  parameter, which controls certain aspects of task execution.
-   All tasks execute asynchronously. That is, when you submit a request, a job identifier is returned to you, which you can use to track progress and retrieve results. See [Check job status](/checking-job-status) for more information.
