## Description

<GAX_DEPRECATION_NOTICE />

The GeoAnalytics Tools service contains a number of tasks that you can access and use in your apps. GeoAnalytics Tools
are available in your ArcGIS Enterprise portal's [Map Viewer Classic](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/geoanalytics-use-the-analysis-tools.htm),
[ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/big-data-analytics/an-overview-of-the-big-data-analytics-toolbox.htm), ArcGIS REST API, and ArcGIS API for
Python. The categories are logical groupings and do not affect how you access or use the tasks in any way.

##  Tasks that summarize data

The tasks that summarize data are described in the following table:

<StyledTable headers={"Task,Description"}>
   <StyledTableRow>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         [Aggregate Points](/aggregate-points)
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         This tool works with a layer of point features and a layer of areas features. Input area features can be from a polygon layer or they can be square or hexagonal bins calculated when the tool is run. The tool first determines which points fall within each specified area. After determining this point-in-area spatial relationship, statistics about all points in the area are calculated and assigned to the area. The most basic statistic is the count of the number of points within the area, but you can get other statistics as well.
      </StyledTableCell>
   </StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableRow>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         [Build Multi-Variable Grid](/build-multi-variable-grid)
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         This tool generates a grid of square or hexagonal bins and calculates variables for each bin based on the proximity of one or more input layers.
      </StyledTableCell>
   </StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableRow>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         [Describe Dataset](/describe-dataset)
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         This tool provides an overview of your big data. By default, the tool outputs a table layer containing calculated field statistics and a JSON string outlining geometry and time settings for the input layer.
      </StyledTableCell>
   </StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableRow>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         [Join Features](/join-features)
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         This tool works with two layers. Join Features joins attributes from one feature to another based on spatial, temporal, and attribute relationships or some combination of the three. The tool determines all input features that meet the specified join conditions and joins the second input layer to the first. You can optionally join all features to the matching features or summarize the matching features.
      </StyledTableCell>
   </StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableRow>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         [Reconstruct Tracks](/reconstruct-tracks)
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         This tool works with a time-enabled layer of either point or area features that represent an instant in time. It first determines which features belong to a track using an identifier. Using the time at each location, the tracks are ordered sequentially and transformed into a line or area representing the path of movement over time. Optionally, the input can be buffered by a field, which will create an area at each location. These buffered points, or input areas, are then joined sequentially to create a track as an area where the width is representative of the attribute of interest. Resulting tracks have a start and end time, which represent temporally the first and last feature in a given track. When the tracks are created, statistics about the input features are calculated and assigned to the output track. The most basic statistic is the count of points within the area, but other statistics can be calculated as well.
      </StyledTableCell>
   </StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableRow>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         [Summarize Attributes](/summarize-attributes)
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         This tool takes an input layer and summarizes and calculates statistics on like values. The most basic statistic is the count of the number of features with a specified value, but you can get other statistics as well.
      </StyledTableCell>
   </StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableRow>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         [Summarize Center and Dispersion](/summarize-center-and-dispersion)
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         This tool finds central features and directional distributions. It can be used to answer questions such as the following:
         -   Where is the center?
         -   Which feature is the most accessible from all other features?
         -   How dispersed, compact, or integrated are the features?
         -   Are there directional trends?
         <Note type={"note"}>
            Summarize Center and Dispersion is not available in the ArcGIS Enterprise portal's Map Viewer Classic. Summarize Center and Dispersion is available through ArcGIS Pro and the ArcGIS Server REST API.

      </StyledTableCell>
   </StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableRow>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         [Summarize Within](/summarize-within)
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         This tool task finds features (and portions of features) that are within the boundaries of areas in the first input layer. The following are examples:
         -   Given a layer of watershed boundaries and a layer of land-use boundaries, calculate the total acreage of land-use type for each watershed.
         -   Given a layer of parcels in a county and a layer of city boundaries, summarize the average value of vacant parcels within each city boundary.
         -   Given a layer of counties and a layer of roads, summarize the total mileage of roads by road type within each county.

      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         [Detect Incidents](/detect-incidents)
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         This tool task works with a time-enabled layer of points, lines, areas, or tables that
         represents an instant in time. Using sequentially ordered features, called tracks, this tool determines which
         features are incidents of interest. Incidents are determined by conditions that you specify. First, the tool
         determines which features belong to a track using one or more fields. Using the time at each feature, the
         tracks are ordered sequentially and the incident condition is applied. Features that meet the starting
         incident condition are marked as an incident. You can optionally apply an ending incident condition; when
         the end condition is true, the feature is no longer an incident. The results will be returned with the
         original features with new columns representing the incident name and indicate which feature meets the
         incident condition. You can return all original features, only the features that are incidents, or all of
         the features within tracks where at least one incident occurred.
      </StyledTableCell>
   </StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableRow>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         [Geocode Locations](/geocode-locations)
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         This tool geocodes a table from a big data file share. The task uses a geocode utility
         service configured with your portal. If you do not have a geocode utility service configured, talk to your
         administrator. [Learn more about configuring a locator service](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/configure-portal-to-geocode-addresses.htm).

         [Calculate Density](/calculate-density-geoanalytics)
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         This tool creates a density map from point features by spreading known quantities of some
         phenomenon (represented as attributes of the points) across the map. The result is a layer of areas classified
         from least dense to most dense.
      </StyledTableCell>
   </StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableRow>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         [Create Space Time Cube](/create-space-time-cube)
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         This tool works with a layer of point features that are time enabled. It aggregates the data
         into a three-dimensional cube of space-time bins. When determining the point in a space-time bin relationship,
         statistics about all points in the space-time bins are calculated and assigned to the bins. The most basic
         statistic is the number of points within the bins, but you can calculate other statistics as well.
         <Note type={"note"}>
            Create Space Time Cube is not available in the ArcGIS Enterprise portal's Map Viewer Classic. Create Space

      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         This tool analyzes point data (such as crime incidents, traffic accidents, trees, and so on)
         or field values associated with points. It finds statistically significant spatial clusters of high incidents
         (hot spots) and low incidents (cold spots). Hot spots are locations with lots of points and cold spots are
         locations with very few points.
      </StyledTableCell>
   </StyledTableRow>
   <StyledTableRow>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         [Create Buffers](/create-buffers)
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         Buffers are typically used to create areas that can be further analyzed using other tools. For example, if the
         question is what buildings are within 1 mile of the school, the answer can be found by creating a 1-mile buffer
         around the school and overlaying the buffer with the layer containing building footprints. The end result is
         a layer of those buildings within 1 mile of the school.

         [Overlay Layers](/overlay-layers)
      </StyledTableCell>
      <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">
         This tool combines two or more layers into one layer. You can think of overlay as peering through a stack of maps and creating a single map containing all the information in the stack. Overlay is more than a merging of line work; all the attributes of the features in the overlay are included in the final product. Overlay Layers is used to answer one of the most basic questions of geography: What is on top of what?
