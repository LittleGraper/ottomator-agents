<GAX_DEPRECATION_NOTICE />

All of the GeoAnalytics Tools create new data. This new data is typically feature data but in some cases, such as with
the [Summarize Attributes](/summarize-attributes) and [Join Features](/join-features) tools, the output can include
tables. These values are returned to you as a URL to a feature service layer. The Create Space Time cube tool returns a
netCDF cube returned as a URL to a .nc file that can be downloaded.

## URL to a feature service

When you specify the `outputName` of a task, the output will be a feature service that is hosted in your organization.
You set the `outputName` parameter to a feature service name of your choosing. The output URL will be the URL to a
layer within the service. Similarly, tables will be saved as layers in a feature service.

## URL to a netCDF file

When you specify the `outputCube` of a [Create Space Time Cube](/create-space-time-cube) task, the output will be a
netCDF file that you can download locally. You set the `outputCube` parameter to a space time cube name of your choosing.

## Big data file share dataset

When you specify the `outputName` of a task and set the `outputDataStore` to a big data file share template, your output
will be a new big data file share dataset. The output parameter will be empty, and the messages will have information
on the location of your new dataset.

For example, the output will look like the following:

```javascript
{
  "paramName": "output",
  "dataType": "GPRecordSet",
  "value": {}
}
```

And the final job message for the GeoAnalytics tool run will look similar to the following:
```javascript
{
  "messageCode":"BD_101227","message":"Big data file share dataset created:
  https://geoanalytics.esri.com/server/rest/services/DataStoreCatalogs/bigDataFileShares_myBDFS_ds_2hl7oyrlw7uw99c2/BigDataCatalogServer/OutputBDFS",
  "params":{"serviceUrl":"https://dev0006300.esri.com/gax/rest/services/DataStoreCatalogs/bigDataFileShares_myBDFS_ds_2hl7oyrlw7uw99c2/BigDataCatalogServer/OutputBDFS"}
}
```
