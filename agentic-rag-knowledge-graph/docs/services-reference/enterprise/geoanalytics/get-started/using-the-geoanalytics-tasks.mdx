##  Feature input 

All GeoAnalytics Tools have input parameters that take features as their input. Features can be input in one of the following ways:

1.  Specify a URL to a feature service layer (or a map service layer that has `query` as one of its capabilities) along with an optional filter.
2.  Specify a URL to a big data file share layer along with an optional filter.
3.  Specify a feature collection.

### URL to a feature service

You can give the URL to a [ feature service layer](/layer-table) or a [map service layer](/layer-table) that has [query capability](/query-map-service-layer).

### URL to a big data catalog service

You can give the URL to a big data catalog service dataset. See [Big Data Catalog Service](/big-data-catalog-service) for more information.

### Feature collection

The other option is to send a `featureCollection` instead of a layer. Filters are supported with feature collections. For more information on feature collections and feature sets, see the Javascript documentation for [featureCollection](DEVSITE/javascript/3/jssamples/fl_featureCollection.html) and [featureSet](DEVSITE/javascript/3/jsapi/featureset.html).

## Feature output

All of the GeoAnalytics Tools create new data. This new data is typically feature data but in some cases, such as with the [Summarize Attributes](/summarize-attributes) and [Join Features](/join-features) tools, the output can include tables. These values are returned to you as a URL to a feature service layer. The Create Space Time cube tool returns a netCDF cube returned as a URL to a .nc file that can be downloaded.

### URL to a feature service

When you specify the `outputName` of a task, the output will be a feature service that is hosted in your organization. You set the `outputName` parameter to a feature service name of your choosing. The output URL will be the URL to a layer within the service. Similarly, tables will be saved as layers in a feature service. 

### URL to a netCDF file

When you specify the `outputCube` of a [Create Space Time Cube](/create-space-time-cube) task, the output will be a netCDF file that you can download locally. You set the `outputCube` parameter to a space time cube name of your choosing.

### Big data file share dataset

When you specify the `outputName` of a task and set the `outputDataStore` to a big data file share template, your output
will be a new big data file share dataset. The output parameter will be empty, and the messages will have information
on the location of your new dataset.

## Check job status

Tasks in the `GeoAnalyticsTools` service execute asynchronously, meaning that you submit a request (or job) and poll the service for the status. When the status is `esriJobSucceeded`, you can access the results of the task. When you submit a request, the `GeoAnalyticsTools` service returns to you a unique job ID for the transaction.

### `jobStatus` values

The `jobStatus` property can have the following values:

-   `esriJobSubmitted`
-   `esriJobWaiting`
-   `esriJobExecuting`
-   `esriJobSucceeded`
-   `esriJobFailed`
-   `esriJobTimedOut`
-   `esriJobCancelling`
-   `esriJobCancelled`
