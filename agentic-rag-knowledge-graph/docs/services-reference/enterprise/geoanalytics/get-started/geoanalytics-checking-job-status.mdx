<GAX_DEPRECATION_NOTICE />

Tasks in the `GeoAnalyticsTools` service execute asynchronously, meaning that you submit a request (or job) and poll the
service for the status. When you submit a request, the `GeoAnalyticsTools` service returns to you a unique job ID for
the transaction. When the status is `esriJobSucceeded`, you can access the results of the task.

Syntax:

```javascript
https://<server url>/arcgis/rest/services/System/GeoAnalyticsTools/GPServer/<task name>/jobs/<jobId>
```
For example, with a server named `myserver` on `esri.com` and a Web Adaptor called `server` that was running
Aggregate Points and the job ID returned was `jbe5013b63142432dac207dcff51b68ds`, the URL for checking the job status
would be `https://myserver.esri.com/server/rest/services/System/GeoAnalyticsTools/GPServer/AggregatePoints/jobs/jbe5013b63142432dac207dcff51b68ds`.

You can use the job ID to periodically check the status of the job and messages. Additionally, if the job has
successfully completed, you can use the job ID to retrieve the results.

## `jobStatus`values

The `jobStatus`property can have the following values:

-   `esriJobSubmitted`
-   `esriJobWaiting`
-   `esriJobExecuting`
-   `esriJobSucceeded`
-   `esriJobFailed`
-   `esriJobTimedOut`
-   `esriJobCancelling`
-   `esriJobCancelled`
