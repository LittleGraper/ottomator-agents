Tasks that have the `extent` property in their `context` parameter will only process features that overlap the specified
 extent. The output features will have an extent that is the same or larger than the `extent`, as illustrated below.

Extent syntax:

```javascript
"extent": {
  "xmin": <minimum x-coordinate>
  "ymin": <minimum y-coordinate>
  "xmax": <maximum x-coordinate>
  "ymax": <maximum y-coordinate>
  "spatialReference": {"wkid": <spatial reference well-known identifier>}
}
```

See the [Spatial Reference](/output-spatial-reference-geoanalytics#GUID-3452C061-0F68-4CAC-96E9-21316EC6AAFB) topic for
information about setting a `wkid` and the `spatialReference` property.

Extent example:

```javascript
"extent": {
  "xmin": -122.68,
  "ymin": 45.53,
  "xmax": -122.45,
  "ymax": 45.6,
  "spatialReference": {
    "wkid": 4326
  }
}
```

`extent` is useful when you need to process only a portion of a larger dataset. You can think of this setting as a rectangle used to select input features for processing. Any feature that overlaps the rectangle defined by the extent will be processed. Note that the rectangle is used only to select features, not clip them. The extent of the output dataset may be larger than the `extent` setting to account for features that overlap the extent rectangle.

You may use a different spatial reference for analysis (`processSR`) and for defining the `extent`. For example, you can
define the `extent` in `wkid` 4326 (GDC_WGS_1984) and analyze in `wkid` 3857 (WGS_1984 Meb Mercator - auxiliary sphere):

Extent and outSR example:

```javascript
"context" : {
  "extent": {
    "xmin": -122.68,
    "ymin": 45.53,
    "xmax": -122.45,
    "ymax": 45.6,
    "spatialReference": {
      "wkid": 4326
    }
  },
  "processSR" : {"wkid" : 3857}
}
```
