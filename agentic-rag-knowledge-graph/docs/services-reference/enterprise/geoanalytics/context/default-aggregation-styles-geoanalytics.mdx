Tasks that have the `defaultAggregationStyles` property set to `true` in their `context` parameter will set the default
aggregations for the resulting layer. If this parameter is set to `true`, default aggregations include square, pointy
triangle, flat triangle, pointy hexagon, flat hexagon, and geohash. All aggregation styles are supported using `wkid` 4326 (WGS_1984).

When you create a map service from the resulting feature service, you can select the aggregation style using ArcGIS
GeoEvent Server or a custom app. The syntax of `defaultAggregationStyles` is illustrated below.

The following is the default aggregation styles syntax:

```javascript
"defaultAggregationStyles": true | false
```


The default aggregation style is supported for point, line and polygon features, and is useful for large datasets, if
you don't want to view all the raw features at once.

You can set the `defaultAggregationStyles` as well as other context parameters, as shown below. The following is the
default aggregation styles, extent, and processSR example:

```javascript
"context" : {
  "defaultAggregationStyles": true,
  "extent": {
    "xmin": -122.68,
    "ymin": 45.53,
    "xmax": -122.45,
    "ymax": 45.6,
    "spatialReference": {
      "wkid": 4326
    }
  },
  "processSR" : {"wkid" : 3857}
}

```
