## Description

This operation releases a set of LRS locks that are held by the person currently invoking.

An error response is returned from this operation when conflict prevention is not enabled on the LRS. Refer to the `conflictPreventionEnabled` property of the [Locks](/lr-locks) resource.

A lock can only be released if the version in which it was acquired does not need to be posted.

The `esriCouldNotReleaseAllLocksNeedToRunAebGpToolOnDefault` release status is returned if you are trying to release a route lock on the default version but the event behaviors have not been applied yet for the corresponding route edit, using the Apply Event Behaviors tool.
