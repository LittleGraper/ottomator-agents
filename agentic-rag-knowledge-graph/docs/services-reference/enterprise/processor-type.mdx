Tasks that have the `processor type`  property in their `context`  parameter allow you to choose where and how you want to process your data. You can process your data using the server computer CPU or GPU. If the `processor type`  property in the `context`  parameter is empty, the task uses CPU to process the data. This is the default.

GPUs are effective at graphics and image processing, for which their highly parallel structure makes them efficient in processing large blocks of data in a repetitive manner. The Raster Analysis tasks that have this setting in context can be distributed across GPU instances at multiple Raster Analysis server machines, as handled by the [Parallel Processing Factor](/parallel-processing-factor).

CPU processing, which is generally located on the frame buffer of the display, can be parallelized across multiple cores and instances, as handled by the [Parallel Processing Factor](/parallel-processing-factor).
