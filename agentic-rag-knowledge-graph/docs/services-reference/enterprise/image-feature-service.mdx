## Description

The `image`  resource represents an individual image associated with a picture symbol. This resource is available only if the layer includes [ Picture Marker Symbols](/symbol-objects) or Picture Fill Symbols. The `url`  property of these symbols should be used as the `imageId`  in the image URL.

The image bytes are directly streamed to the client.
