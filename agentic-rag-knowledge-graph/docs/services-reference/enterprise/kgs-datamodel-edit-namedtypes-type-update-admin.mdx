## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

<GUID_01CB5051_FA79_42A9_8275_EF008F2C3097_GUID_499B73EC_3D4E_46D2_863A_4534FAF79AA3 />

</Note>

The `update`  operation is available for a knowledge graph service data model's [administrative named types resource](/kgs-datamodel-edit-namedtypes-admin). With this operation, an administrative client can update an entity type or relationship type in the data model. Identify the [type](/kgs-datamodel-edit-namedtypes-type-admin) you want to update by specifying the type name. Use the data model [query](/kgs-datamodel-query) operation to learn about the item types that are defined in the schema.

You must have [sufficient privileges to edit content](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/roles.htm) and editing must be enabled for the knowledge graph service for this operation to be successful. You can enable editing for a knowledge graph service in the same way that you [enable it for a hosted feature layer](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/manage-hosted-feature-layers.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_030A9819DFF7498E9DFCDE6030E5FFBA). The knowledge graph service's `strict`  property must not be set to true, which indicates the data model cannot be modified.

If the knowledge graph service's data model can be updated, you can use this operation to set the `strict`  property for a specific type. For example, making this change would mean only the owner of the service or the service administrator can add or remove properties for this type. The `strict`  property can be set for both entity types and relationship types. 

For relationship types, you can additionally set properties to indicate whether the types that can participate in a relationship are flexible. If a HasVehicle relationship type should only be used to connect a Person entity with a Vehicle entity, you can set both the `strictOrigin`  property and `strictDest`  properties to true. In contrast, the default HasDocument relationship type has the `strictDest`  property set to true because the destination of any HasDocument relationship must have a Document entity type. However, any type of entity can have a HasDocument relationship, so the HasDocument relationship type has its `strictOrigin`  property set to false.

## JSON Response syntax

```json
{
  "strict": <boolean>,
  "strictOrigin": <boolean>,
  "strictDest": <boolean>
}

```

 

## JSON Response example

```json
{
  "strict": true,
  "strictOrigin": false,
  "strictDest": true
}
```
