## Description

<Note>
The ArcGIS Data Reviewer extension is required to use this resource.
</Note>

<Note>
This resource is dependent on the ArcGIS Data Reviewer ArcMap runtime-based server object extension (SOE). ArcGIS Enterprise 10.9.x, part of the ArcGIS 2021 releases, is the last release of ArcGIS Enterprise to support services published from ArcMap.

Consider Data Reviewer capabilities enabled using ArcGIS Pro and integrated in the [Validation service](/validation-server).
</Note>

Data Reviewer defines a Reviewer result as a row, or feature, submitted to the Reviewer workspace. Data Reviewer exposes a quality control workflow in which a result is reviewed, corrected, and verified.

There are three lifecycle phases:

-   Review
-   Correction
-   Verification

This REST operation retrieves a JSON array of lifecycle phase objects. Each array member has a `descriptionType`, `descriptionString`, and `descriptionCode`. Use this REST operation to retrieve lifecycle phase strings for the lifecycle phase code values returned from other REST operations like [Get Results](/rest-get-results) and [Dashboard](/rest-dashboard).

##  Request parameters
