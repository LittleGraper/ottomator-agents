## Description

An individual image resource represents an individual image associated with a picture symbol. This resource is available only if the layer includes [Picture Marker Symbols](/symbol-objects/#picture-marker-symbol) or [Picture Fill Symbols](/symbol-objects/#picture-fill-symbol). The `url`  property of these symbols should be used as the `imageId`  in the image URL.

This resource also returns symbols associated with the layer's legend. Refer to the [ Map Service Legend](/legend-map-service) resource for more details.

The image bytes are directly streamed to the client.

## Example usage

The following is a sample request URL used to access an individual image resource: 

```javascript
https://machine.domain.com/webadaptor/rest/services/SF311/MapServer/0/images/a3f2bf9c04e860d4f8cb6235fa1bc98b
```
