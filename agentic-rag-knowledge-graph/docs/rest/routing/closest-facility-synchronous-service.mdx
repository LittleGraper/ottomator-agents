Finding the closest hospital to an accident, the closest police cars to a crime scene, and the closest store to a customer's address are examples of problems that can be solved using the Closest facility service. When finding the closest facilities, you can specify how many to find and whether the direction of travel is toward or away from them. Once you've found the closest facilities, you can display the best route to or from them and include the travel time, travel distance, and driving directions to each facility. The service can use current traffic conditions when determining the best routes. You can also specify an impedance cutoff beyond which the service will not search for a facility. For instance, you can set up a Closest facility service to search for hospitals within a 15-minute drive time of the site of an accident. Any hospitals that take longer than 15 minutes to reach will not be included in the results. The hospitals are referred to as facilities, and the accident is referred to as an incident. The service allows you to perform multiple closest facility analyses simultaneously. This means you can have multiple incidents and find the closest facility or facilities to each incident.

<Note type={"note"}>

The service works in all the supported countries as listed in the [data coverage page](/network-coverage). One or more countries are grouped together to form an analysis region. The service can determine the best region to use based on the location of the inputs; otherwise, you can use a parameter to specify a region. The service does not support requests that span more than one region. Consequently, the service will only generate results for inputs that fall within one region. 

</Note>

See the [Route to the closest destination](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/rest/route-to-the-closest-destination/) tutorial to learn more on how to get a route to the closest destination using direct request.

## Request URL

The Closest facility service supports [direct request](DEVSITE/documentation/glossary/direct-request/) and [job request](DEVSITE/documentation/glossary/job-request/). You can choose a request type based on the size of the problem you are trying to solve.

To learn more about the direct request, see [Job request](/closest-facility-asynchronous-service) documentation.

You can make a direct request to the Closest facility service using the following form:

`https://route.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/ClosestFacility/NAServer/ClosestFacility_World/solveClosestFacility?parameters` 

## Request parameters

The closest facility request takes the following parameters. The only required parameters are `incidents` , `facilities` , `token` , and `f` . The optional parameters have default values that will be used if the parameter is not specified in the request.

## Required parameters

The following parameters are required.

### incidents

Use this parameter to specify one or more locations from which the service searches for the nearby locations. These locations are referred to as incidents.

You can use a simple comma- and semicolon-based syntax if you are passing the input locations using their longitude and latitude values in the WGS84 coordinate system and don't need to pass additional fields for each location.

<Note type={"caution"}>

The service imposes a limit of 100 points that can be passed as incidents. If the value is exceeded, the response returns an error message.

</Note>

```other
incidents=x1,y1; x2, y2; ...; xn, yn
```

 

```other
incidents=-117.1957,34.0564; -117.184,34.0546
```

 

The `incidents`  parameter can be specified using a JSON structure that references a set of point features. The property is optional; however, the JSON structure must specify either the `url`  or `features`  property: 

-   `url` —Specify a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set. 

    The JSON structure can include the following property: 

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .
-   `features` —Specify an array of features. 

    Each feature in the `features`  array represents an incident and contains the following properties:

    -   `geometry` —Specify the input point geometry containing `x`  and `y`  properties along with the `spatialReference`  property. If the `spatialReference`  property is defined for the entire JSON, you don't need to define this property for each geometry. Doing so reduces the size of the input JSON if the input has many features and improves performance. This property is not required if the coordinates are in the default spatial reference, WGS84. If the coordinates are in a different spatial reference, you must specify the spatial reference's well-known ID (WKID). See [Using spatial references](DEVSITE/rest/services-reference/enterprise/using-spatial-references) to look up WKID values.

        <Note type={"tip"}>

        It is recommended that you explicitly specify the `spatialReference`  value, and specify it for the entire JSON rather than each individual geometry. 

        </Note>
    -   `attributes` —Specify each attribute as a key-value pair in which the key is the name of a given field, and the value is the attribute value for the corresponding field.

    The JSON structure can include the following property:

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .

#### Attributes for incidents

When specifying the incidents, you can set properties for each—such as its name or service time—using the following attributes:

-   `Name` 

    The name of the incident. The name is used in the driving directions. If the name is not specified, a unique name prefixed with Location is automatically generated in the output routes and directions.
-   `ObjectID` 

    The object ID of the incident. `ObjectID`  is a unique identifier for the incident. If you want to maintain a relationship between input and output, set `preserveObjectID`  to `true` , and the `ObjectID`  value of the input incident is included in the output routes (as the `IncidentID`  field). The `ObjectID`  value is also included in the output incidents (as the `ObjectID`  field) and can be used to join additional information from the analysis outputs to the attribute of the incidents. If the `ObjectID`  value is not specified, a unique ID is automatically generated in the output.
-   `TargetFacilityCount` —Specify the number of facilities that need to be found for the incident. 

    If `TargetFacilityCount`  is not set for an incident, the service will use the value specified as the `defaultTargetFacilityCount`  parameter. The value for the `TargetFacilityCount`  attribute allows the ability to overwrite the `defaultTargetFacilityCount`  value on a per incident basis. The default value for this attribute is `null` , which causes the service to use the value set for the `defaultTargetFacilityCount`  parameter. If the `TargetFacilityCount`  attribute is set to a value other than `null` , the `defaultTargetFacilityCount`  value is overwritten.
-   `CurbApproach` 

    Specifies the direction a vehicle may arrive at and depart from the incident. The field value is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):

    One of the integers listed in the Coded value column in the following table must be specified as a value of this attribute. The values in the Setting column are the descriptive names for `CurbApproach`  attribute values that you may have seen when using the ArcGIS Network Analyst extension software.

    The `CurbApproach`  attribute is designed to work with both types of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider an incident on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards is your decision to approach an incident from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at an incident and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the incident, choose 1 (Right side of vehicle) in the United States and 2 (Left side of vehicle) in the United Kingdom.

-   `Attr_[Cost]` 

    This field specifies how much additional time spent or distance traveled can occur at the incident.

    To determine the units of the field, refer to the units of the network cost attribute specified in the field name. For instance, if there is a `TravelTime`  cost attribute that has a unit of minutes, `Attr_TravelTime`  will be in minutes.

    A zero or null value indicates that the incident requires no service time or extra distance traveled. The default value is 0.

    You can add time to a incident to represent how long it takes to make a delivery, install equipment, or perform some other task at the incident. Similarly, adding extra distance may be useful to account for a long driveway or other road that isn't represented by the network dataset.

    If you have multiple network cost attributes, there will be multiple `Attr_[Cost]`  fields. Consequently, you may have more than one time- or distance-based `Attr_[Cost]`  field. The field values you provide are only referenced if the cost attribute referred to in the field name is used in the analysis, for instance, to minimize or accumulate time or distance.

    `Attr_[Cost]`  is only referenced if cost is used in the analysis as impedance or accumulate attribute.

    See the [list of cost attributes](/closest-facility-synchronous-service#impedanceattributename) supported by the service.

    For example, when a time-based cost attribute `TravelTime`  is used, it specifies the amount of time for cars, in minutes, that will be added to the total travel time of the route between the incident and the closest facility. The attribute value can be used to model the time spent at the incident. For example, if you are finding the three closest fire stations from a fire incident, the attribute can store the amount of time spent at the fire incident. This could be the time it takes for firefighters to hook up their equipment and begin fighting the fire. The value for this attribute is included in the total travel time for the route and is also displayed in driving directions as service time. `Attr_TravelTime`  is only referenced if `TravelTime`  is used in the analysis as impedance or accumulate attribute. A zero or null value indicates that the incident requires no service time.

    However, when a distance-based cost attribute like `Miles`  is used, it specifies the distance in miles that will be added to the total distance of the route between the incident and the closest facility. Generally the locations of the incidents are not exactly on the streets but are set back somewhat from the road. This attribute value can be used to model the distance between the actual incident location and its location on the street if it is important to include that distance in the total travel distance. `Attr_Miles`  is only referenced if `Miles`  is used in the analysis as impedance or accumulate attribute.
-   `Cutoff_[Impedance]` 

    Specify the travel time or distance at which to stop searching for facilities for a given incident.

    If `Cutoff_[Impedance]`  is not set for an incident, the service will use the value specified as the `defaultCutoff`  parameter. The default value for this attribute is null, which causes the service to use the value set for the `defaultCutoff`  parameter. If the `Cutoff_[Impedance]`  attribute is set to a value other than null, the `defaultCutoff`  value is overridden.

    If you have multiple network cost attributes, you'll see multiple `Cutoff_[Impedance]`  fields. Consequently, you may have more than one time- or distance-based `Cutoff_[Impedance]`  field. The field values you provide are only referenced if the cost attribute referred to in the field name is used in the analysis as impedance attribute, it is not used if the attribute is used in the analysis as accumulate attribute.

    See the [list of cutoff impedance attributes](/closest-facility-synchronous-service#impedanceattributename) supported by the service.

    For example, when a time-based cutoff impedance `TravelTime`  is used, it will specify the travel time for cars, in minutes, at which to stop searching for facilities for a given incident. Any incident beyond the cutoff value will not be searched. If `Cutoff_TravelTime`  is not set for an incident, the service will use the value specified as the `defaultCutoff`  parameter. The value for the `Cutoff_TravelTime`  attribute allows the ability to overwrite the `defaultCutoff`  value on a per incident basis. The default value for this attribute is `null` , which indicates not to use any cutoff.

    However, when a distance-based cutoff impedance like `Miles`  is used, it will specify the travel distance in miles at which to stop searching for facilities for a given incident. Any incident beyond the cutoff value will not be searched. If `Cutoff_Miles`  is not set for an incident, the service will use the value specified as the `defaultCutoff`  parameter. The value for the `Cutoff_Miles`  attribute allows the ability to overwrite the `defaultCutoff`  value on a per incident basis. The default value for this attribute is `null` , which indicates not to use any cutoff.
-   `Bearing` 

    The direction in which a point is moving. The units are degrees and are measured clockwise from true north. This field is used in conjunction with the `BearingTol`  field. 

    Bearing data is usually sent automatically from a mobile device equipped with a GPS receiver. Try to include bearing data if you are loading an input location that is moving, such as a pedestrian or a vehicle. 

    Using this field tends to prevent adding locations to the wrong edges, which can occur when a vehicle is near an intersection or an overpass, for example. Bearing also helps the tool determine on which side of the street the point is. 

    [Learn more about bearing and bearing tolerance](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/networks/bearing-and-bearing-tolerance.htm)
-   `BearingTol` 

    The bearing tolerance value creates a range of acceptable bearing values when locating moving points on an edge using the `Bearing`  field. If the `Bearing`  field value is within the range of acceptable values that are generated from the bearing tolerance on an edge, the point can be added as a network location there; otherwise, the closest point on the next-nearest edge is evaluated. 

    The units are in degrees, and the default value is 30. Values must be greater than 0 and less than 180. A value of 30 means that when Network Analyst attempts to add a network location on an edge, a range of acceptable bearing values is generated 15 degrees to either side of the edge (left and right) and in both digitized directions of the edge. 

    [Learn more about bearing and bearing tolerance](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/networks/bearing-and-bearing-tolerance.htm)
-   `NavLatency` 

    This field is only used in the solve process if the `Bearing`  and `BearingTol`  fields also have values; however, entering a `NavLatency`  field value is optional, even when values are present in `Bearing`  and `BearingTol` . `NavLatency`  indicates how much cost is expected to elapse from the moment GPS information is sent from a moving vehicle to a server and the moment the processed route is received by the vehicle's navigation device. 

    The units of `NavLatency`  are the same as the units of the impedance attribute.

#### Syntax examples for incidents

The following is the syntax for specifying incidents using JSON structure for features:

```other
{
  "spatialReference": {
    "wkid": <wkid>,
    "latestWkid": <wkid>
  },
  "features": [
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": <x>,
        "y": <y>
      },
      "attributes": {
        "<field1>": <value11>,
        "<field2>": <value12>
      }
    },
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": <x>,
        "y": <y>
      },
      "attributes": {
        "<field1>": <value21>,
        "<field2>": <value22>
      }
    }
  ],
  "doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements": true | false
}


```

 

The following is the syntax for specifying incidents using a URL returning a JSON response:

```other
{
  "url": "<url>"
  "doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements": true | false
}
```

 

#### Examples for incidents

Example one: Specifying incident geometries and attributes using JSON structure

The example also shows how to specify the `Name`  attribute for each incident and specify a service time for each incident using the `Attr_TraveTime`  attribute. 

```other
{
  "spatialReference": {
    "wkid": 4326
  },

  "features": [
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -122.4079,
        "y": 37.78356
      },
      "attributes": {
        "Name": "Fire Incident 1",
        "Attr_TravelTime": 4
      }
    },
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -122.404,
        "y": 37.782
      },
      "attributes": {
        "Name": "Crime Incident 45",
        "Attr_TravelTime": 5
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

 

Example two: Specifying incident geometries in the Web Mercator spatial reference using JSON structure

The example also shows how to specify the `Name`  attribute for each incident and specify the distance in miles between the actual incident location and its location on the street using the `Attr_Miles`  attribute. 

```other
{
"spatialReference": {
    "wkid": 102100
  },
  "features": [
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -13635398.9398,
        "y": 4544699.034400001,
      },
      "attributes": {
        "Name": "123 Main St",
        "Attr_Miles": 0.29
      }
    },
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -13632733.3441,
        "y": 4547651.028300002,
      },
      "attributes": {
        "Name": "845 Mulberry St",
        "Attr_Miles" : 0.31
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

 

Example three: Specifying incidents using a URL

The URL makes a query for a few features from a map service. A URL querying features from a feature service can also be specified.

```other
{
    "url": "https://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Network/USA/MapServer/1/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=Name,RouteName&f=json"
}
```

 

### facilities

Use this parameter to specify one or more locations that are searched for when finding the closest location. These locations are referred to as facilities.

<Note type={"caution"}>

The service imposes a limit of 100 points that can be passed as facilities. If the value is exceeded, the response returns an error message.

</Note>

You can use a simple comma- and semicolon-based syntax if you are passing the facilities using their longitude and latitude values in the WGS84 coordinate system and don't need to pass additional fields for each location.

The following is the simple syntax for facilities:

```other
facilities=x1,y1; x2, y2; ...; xn, yn
```

 

Example using simple syntax

```other
facilities=-117.1957,34.0564; -117.184,34.0546
```

 

The `facilities`  parameter can be specified using a JSON structure that references a set of point features. The property is optional; however, the JSON structure must specify either the `url`  or `feature`  property: 

-   `url` —Specify a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set. 

    The JSON structure can include the following property: 

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .
-   `features` —Specify an array of features. 

    Each feature in the `features`  array represents a facility and contains the following properties:

    -   `geometry` —Specify the input point geometry containing `x`  and `y`  properties along with the `spatialReference`  property. If the `spatialReference`  property is defined for the entire JSON, you don't need to define this property for each geometry. Doing so reduces the size of the input JSON if the input has many features and improves performance. This property is not required if the coordinates are in the default spatial reference, WGS84. If the coordinates are in a different spatial reference, you must specify the spatial reference's well-known ID (WKID). See [Using spatial references](DEVSITE/rest/services-reference/enterprise/using-spatial-references) to look up WKID values.

        <Note type={"tip"}>

        It is recommended that you explicitly specify the `spatialReference`  value, and specify it for the entire JSON rather than each individual geometry. 

        </Note>
    -   `attributes` —Specify each attribute as a key-value pair in which the key is the name of a given field, and the value is the attribute value for the corresponding field.

    The JSON structure can include the following property:

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .

#### Attributes for facilities

When specifying the stops using JSON structure, you can specify additional properties for facilities such as their names using attributes. The `facilities`  parameter can be specified with the following attributes: 

-   `Name` 

    The name of the facility. The name is used in the driving directions. If the name is not specified, a unique name prefixed with Location is automatically generated in the output routes and directions.
-   `ObjectID` 

    The object ID of the facility. `ObjectID`  is a unique identifier for the facility. If you want to maintain a relationship between input and output, set `preserveObjectID`  to `true` , and the `ObjectID`  value of the input facility is included in the output routes (as the `FacilityID`  field). The `ObjectID`  value is also included in the output facilities (as the `ObjectID`  field) and can be used to join additional information from the analysis outputs to the attribute of the facilities. If the `ObjectID`  value is not specified, a unique ID is automatically generated in the output.
-   `CurbApproach` 

    Specifies the direction a vehicle may arrive at and depart from the facility. 

    One of the integers listed in the Coded value column in the following table must be specified as a value of this attribute. The values in the Setting column are the descriptive names for `CurbApproach`  attribute values that you may have seen when using the ArcGIS Network Analyst extension software.

-   `Attr_[Cost]` 

    This field specifies how much additional time spent or distance traveled can occur at the facility.

    To determine the units of the field, refer to the units of the network cost attribute specified in the field name. For instance, if there is a `TravelTime`  cost attribute that has a unit of minutes, `Attr_TravelTime`  will be in minutes.

    A zero or null value indicates that the facility requires no service time or extra distance traveled. The default value is 0.

    You can add time to a facility to represent how long it takes to perform other tasks at the facility. Similarly, adding extra distance may be useful to account for a long driveway or other road that isn't represented by the network dataset.

    If you have multiple network cost attributes, you'll see multiple `Attr_[Cost]`  fields. Consequently, you may have more than one time- or distance-based `Attr_[Cost]`  field. The field values you provide are only referenced if the cost attribute referred to in the field name is used in the analysis, for instance, to minimize or accumulate time or distance.

     A zero or null value indicates that the facility requires no service time. `Attr_[Cost]`  is only referenced if cost is used in the analysis as impedance or accumulate attribute.

    See the [list of cost attributes](/closest-facility-synchronous-service#UL_E9A3D790597F4A02B7A9DD23C6A4ABDE) supported by the service.

    For example, when a time-based cost attribute `TravelTime`  is used, it specifies the amount of time for cars, in minutes, that will be added to the total travel time of the route between the incident and the closest facility. The attribute value can be used to specify the turnout time for the facility. For example, when finding the three closest fire stations from a fire incident, this attribute can be used to store the time it takes a crew to don the appropriate protective equipment and exit the fire station. The value for this attribute is included in the total travel time for the route and is also displayed in driving directions as service time. `Attr_TravelTime`  is only referenced if `TravelTime`  is used in the analysis as impedance or accumulate attribute. A zero or null value indicates that the facility requires no service time. 

    However, when a distance-based cost attribute like `Miles`  is used, it specifies the distance in miles that will added to the total distance of the route between the incident and the closest facility. Generally the locations of the facilities are not exactly on the streets but are set back somewhat from the road. This attribute value can be used to model the distance between the actual facility location and its location on the street if it is important to include that distance in the total travel distance. `Attr_Miles`  is only referenced if `Miles`  is used in the analysis as impedance or accumulate attribute. 
-   `Cutoff_[Impedance]` 

    Specify the travel time or distance at which to stop searching for facilities for a given incident.

    If `Cutoff_[Impedance]`  is not set for an incident, the service will use the value specified as the `defaultCutoff`  parameter. The default value for this attribute is null, which causes the service to use the value set for the `defaultCutoff`  parameter. If the `Cutoff_[Impedance]`  attribute is set to a value other than null, the `defaultCutoff`  value is overridden.

    If you have multiple network cost attributes, you'll see multiple `Cutoff_[Impedance]`  fields. Consequently, you may have more than one time- or distance-based `Cutoff_[Impedance]`  field. The field values you provide are only referenced if the cost attribute referred to in the field name is used in the analysis as impedance attribute, it is not used if the attribute is used in the analysis as accumulate attribute. 

    See the [list of cutoff impedance attributes](/closest-facility-synchronous-service#UL_E9A3D790597F4A02B7A9DD23C6A4ABDE) supported by the service.

    For example, when a time-based cutoff impedance `TravelTime`  is used, it will specify the travel time for cars, in minutes, at which to stop searching for facilities for a given incident. Any incident beyond the cutoff value will not be searched. If `Cutoff_TravelTime`  is not set for a facility, the service will use the value specified as the `defaultCutoff`  parameter. The value for the `Cutoff_TravelTime`  attribute allows the ability to overwrite the `defaultCutoff`  value on a per facility basis. The default value for this attribute is `null` , which indicates not to use any cutoff.

    However, when a distance-based cutoff impedance like `Miles`  is used, it will specify the travel distance in miles at which to stop searching for facilities for a given incident.

The value for the `Cutoff_Miles`  attribute allows the ability to overwrite the `defaultCutoff`  value on a per facility basis. The default value for this attribute is `null` , which indicates not to use any cutoff.
-   `Bearing` 

    The direction in which a point is moving. The units are degrees and are measured clockwise from true north. This field is used in conjunction with the `BearingTol`  field. 

    Bearing data is usually sent automatically from a mobile device equipped with a GPS receiver. Try to include bearing data if you are loading an input location that is moving, such as a pedestrian or a vehicle. 

    Using this field tends to prevent adding locations to the wrong edges, which can occur when a vehicle is near an intersection or an overpass, for example. Bearing also helps the tool determine on which side of the street the point is. 

    [Learn more about bearing and bearing tolerance](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/networks/bearing-and-bearing-tolerance.htm)
-   `BearingTol` 

    The bearing tolerance value creates a range of acceptable bearing values when locating moving points on an edge using the `Bearing`  field. If the `Bearing`  field value is within the range of acceptable values that are generated from the bearing tolerance on an edge, the point can be added as a network location there; otherwise, the closest point on the next-nearest edge is evaluated. 

    The units are in degrees, and the default value is 30. Values must be greater than 0 and less than 180. A value of 30 means that when Network Analyst attempts to add a network location on an edge, a range of acceptable bearing values is generated 15 degrees to either side of the edge (left and right) and in both digitized directions of the edge. 

    [Learn more about bearing and bearing tolerance](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/networks/bearing-and-bearing-tolerance.htm)
-   `NavLatency` 

    This field is only used in the solve process if the `Bearing`  and `BearingTol`  fields also have values; however, entering a `NavLatency`  field value is optional, even when values are present in `Bearing`  and `BearingTol` . `NavLatency`  indicates how much cost is expected to elapse from the moment GPS information is sent from a moving vehicle to a server and the moment the processed route is received by the vehicle's navigation device. 

    The units of `NavLatency`  are the same as the units of the impedance attribute.

#### Syntax for facilities

The following is the syntax for specifying `facilities`  using JSON structure for features:

```other
{
    "spatialReference": {
      "wkid": <wkid>,
      "latestWkid": <wkid>
    },               
    "features": [
        {
            "geometry": {
                "x": <x>,
                "y": <y>,
                
            },
            "attributes": {
                "<field1>": <value11>,
                "<field2>": <value12>
            }
        },
        {
            "geometry": {
                "x": <x>,
                "y": <y>,
            },
            "attributes": {
                "<field1>": <value21>,
                "<field2>": <value22>
            }
        }
    ],
    "doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements": true | false 
}
```

 

The following is the syntax for specifying facilities using a URL returning a JSON response:

```other
{
    "url": "<url>"
    "doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements": true | false
}
```

 

#### Examples for facilities

Example one: Specifying facility geometries and attributes using JSON structure 

The example also shows how to specify the `Name`  attribute and a service time for each facility using the `Attr_TraveTime`  attribute. 

```other
{ 
  "spatialReference": {
    "wkid": 4326
  },

  "features": [
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -122.4079,
        "y": 37.78356
      },
      "attributes": {
        "Name": "Fire Station 34",
        "Attr_TravelTime": 4
      }
    },
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -122.404,
        "y": 37.782
      },
      "attributes": {
        "Name": "Fire Station 29",
        "Attr_TravelTime": 5
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

 

Example two: Specifying facility geometries in the Web Mercator spatial reference using JSON structure

The example also shows how to specify the `Name`  attribute for each facility and the distance in miles between the actual facility location and its location on the street using the `Attr_Miles`  attribute.

```other
{
  "spatialReference": {
    "wkid": 102100
  },
  "features": [
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -13635398.9398,
        "y": 4544699.034400001,
      },
      "attributes": {
        "Name": "Store 45",
        "Attr_Miles": 0.29
      }
    },
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -13632733.3441,
        "y": 4547651.028300002,
      },
      "attributes": {
        "Name": "Store 67",
        "Attr_Miles" : 0.31
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

 

Example three: Specifying facilities using a URL

The URL makes a query for a few features from a map service. A URL querying features from a feature service can also be specified.

```other
{
    "url": "https://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Network/USA/MapServer/1/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=Name,RouteName&f=json"
}
```

 

### returnCFRoutes

Use this parameter to specify whether the service will return routes.

-   `true` —Routes are returned. The routes are available in the `routes`  property of the JSON response. The shape of the routes depends on the value for the `outputLines`  parameter.
-   `false` —Routes are not returned. 

<Note type={"caution"}>

The default value for the `returnCFRoutes`  parameter is `false` . To return the best routes between the incident and the closest facilities, specify `true`  for this parameter. If you also want the service to return the point features representing the closest facilities from the incidents, specify the `returnFacilities`  parameter as `true` .

</Note>

<Note type={"tip"}>

If you don't want to return routes because the application has to display only the driving directions between the stops, you can set the `returnDirections`  parameter to `true`  and the `returnCFRoutes`  parameter to `false` . In this case, returning the routes will not provide any additional information and will increase the overall response size.

</Note>

### token

Use this parameter to specify a token that provides the identity of a user that has the permissions to access the service. The [security and authentication](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/security/) page provides more information about how an access token can be obtained.

```other
token=<yourToken>
```

 

### f

Use this parameter to specify the response format. The parameter can have `json`  or `pjson`  as arguments, for example, `f=json` . The `pjson`  value is used for printing the JSON response in a prettified format. 

## Optional parameters

The following parameters are optional.

### travelMode

Choose the mode of transportation for the analysis. 

Travel modes are managed in ArcGIS Online and can be configured by the administrator of your organization to better reflect the organization's workflows. 

[Learn more about travel modes](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/travel-modes.htm)

The value for the `travelMode`  parameter is the JSON object containing the settings for a travel mode supported by your organization. To get the supported travel modes, run the `retrieveTravelModes`  service.

You can make a request to retrieve travel modes using the following form:

```javascript
https://route.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/ClosestFacility/NAServer/ClosestFacility_World/retrieveTravelModes?f=json&token=
```

 

<Note type={"note"}>

If you copy the URL above into a web browser, an invalid token error message will appear. You must replace `<yourToken>`  with a valid token. See [Security and authentication](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/security/) to learn how to generate one. 

</Note>

The response below is returned by the `retrieveTravelModes`  service.

<Note type={"note"}>

Because the response is quite verbose, the elements in the response are abbreviated for clarity.

From the JSON above, to pass `Walking Time`  as the travel mode, use the following JSON as the value for the `travelMode`  parameter:

```other
travelMode={"attributeParameterValues": [{"parameterName": "Restriction Usage","attributeName": "Walking","value": "PROHIBITED"},{"parameterName": "Restriction Usage","attributeName": "Preferred for Pedestrians","value": "PREFER_LOW"},{"parameterName": "Walking Speed (km/h)","attributeName": "WalkTime","value": 5}],"description": "Follows paths and roads that allow pedestrian traffic and finds solutions that optimize travel time. The walking speed is set to 5 kilometers per hour.","impedanceAttributeName": "WalkTime","simplificationToleranceUnits": "esriMeters","uturnAtJunctions": "esriNFSBAllowBacktrack","restrictionAttributeNames": ["Preferred for Pedestrians","Walking"],"useHierarchy": false,"simplificationTolerance": 2,"timeAttributeName": "WalkTime","distanceAttributeName": "Miles","type": "WALK","id": "caFAgoThrvUpkFBW","name": "Walking Time"}
```

 

<Note type={"caution"}>

When the `travelMode`  parameter is set, you are choosing a travel mode configured in your organization, and the service automatically overrides the values of other parameters with values that model the chosen travel mode. The following parameters are overridden: `impedanceAttributeName` , `attributeParameterValues` , `restrictUturns` , `useHierarchy` , `restrictionAttributeNames` , and `directionsTimeAttributeName` . 

If you don't set the `travelMode`  parameter, the service honors the default or user-defined values for the parameters that would otherwise be overridden, so you can create your own travel mode.

</Note>

### defaultTargetFacilityCount

The number of closest facilities to find per incident. This is useful in situations in which multiple fire engines may be required from different fire stations, such as a fire. You can specify, for example, to find the three nearest fire stations to a fire.

<Note type={"note"}>

The service imposes a maximum limit of 10 facilities to find from each incident.

</Note>

The value for this parameter can be overridden on a per-incident basis by specifying a value for the `TargetFacilityCount`  attribute when specifying the `incidents`  parameter.

### travelDirection

Specifies how the travel direction for the closest facility search will be measured.

This parameter can be specified using the following values:

-   `esriNATravelDirectionFromFacility` —The direction of travel is from facilities to incidents.
-   `esriNATravelDirectionToFacility` —The direction of travel is from incidents to facilities.

Each option may find different facilities, as the travel time along some streets may vary based on the travel direction and one-way restrictions. For instance, a facility may be a 10-minute drive from the incident while traveling from the incident to the facility, but while traveling from the facility to the incident, it may be a 15-minute drive because of different travel time in that direction. 

Fire departments commonly use the `esriNATravelDirectionFromFacility`  value for the parameter since they are concerned with the time it takes to travel from the fire station (facility) to the location of the emergency (incident). A retail store (facility) is more concerned with the time it takes the shoppers (incidents) to reach the store; retail stores commonly use the `esriNATravelDirectionToFacility`  parameter value.

The default value for this parameter is `esriNATravelDirectionToFacility` .

### defaultCutoff

The travel time or travel distance value at which to stop searching for facilities for a given incident. For example, while finding the closest hospitals from the site of an accident, a cutoff value of 15 minutes means that the tool will search for the closest hospital within 15 minutes from the incident. If the closest hospital is 17 minutes away, no routes will be returned in the output routes. A cutoff value is especially useful when searching for multiple facilities.

The unit for this parameter is based on the unit of the impedance attribute specified using the `impedanceAttributeName`  parameter or the `impedanceAttributeName`  value of the travel mode if a travel mode is specified . If the `impedanceAttributeName`  parameter is `TravelTime` , the `defaultCutoff`  value is specified in minutes. Otherwise, the value is specified in miles or kilometers based on whether the `impedanceAttributeName`  parameter is set to `Miles`  or `Kilometers` , respectively.

The value for the `defaultCutoff`  parameter can be overridden on a per-incident or facility basis by specifying a value for the `Cutoff_[Impedance]`  attribute when specifying the `incidents`  or the `facilities`  parameter values.

### timeOfDay

Specify the time and date to depart from or arrive at incidents or facilities. You can also specify a value of `now`  to set the depart or arrive time to the current time.

Specifying a time of day results in more accurate estimations of travel times because the travel times account for the traffic conditions that are applicable for that date and time. 

To use traffic in the analysis, set `impedanceAttributeName`  to `TravelTime` , and assign a `timeOfDay`  value. 

The `timeOfDay`  value represents the target start time or arrival time of the routes in the analysis. The time is specified as UNIX time (milliseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970).

If a value of `now`  is passed to the `timeOfDay`  parameter, the travel begins at the current time. This will also override the `timeOfDayIsUTC`  parameter value to be `true` . When `timeOfDay`  is `now`  and `timeOfDayIsUTC`  is `true` , the travel will begin or end at input locations at the current time regardless of the time zone of the input locations. 

If a time of day is not passed in, the service uses static road speeds based on average historical speeds or posted speed limits. It uses posted speeds in areas where historical traffic information isn't available.

<Note type={"note"}>

Traffic is supported only with the driving time impedance or travel mode. It's not supported with trucking.

</Note>

The service support two kinds of traffic: live and typical.

If the `timeOfDay`  value specified is within 1 hour of the current time, live traffic will be used where available. Live traffic retrieves speeds based on phone probe records, sensors, and other data sources and reflects the current travel speeds and predicts speeds for the near future. If the `timeOfDay`  value specified is more than 1 hour earlier or later than the current time, or the road does not have live traffic, typical traffic speeds will be used. Typical speeds are based on historical traffic patterns. The travel time data is aggregated in 15-minute intervals per day of week based on multiple years worth of data. Consequently, a road may have a different travel time at Monday at 8:00 a.m., Monday at 8:15 a.m., or Tuesday at 8:00 a.m.. Since the variance is at the day of week and time of day, the travel time is the same on a road for any Monday at 8:00 a.m., regardless of the month or year.

If your goal is to model typical travel conditions and avoid large variances from the average due to live traffic, it is recommended that you use a date from the past to ensure that it doesn't coincide with the 1-hour window from the current time. As an extreme example, you can even use dates from 1990.

[ArcGIS Online Directions and Routing Services Coverage](http://links.esri.com/arcgis-online-data-coverage-map-for-directions-and-routes) shows the countries Esri currently provides traffic data for.

#### Typical traffic

To ensure the task uses typical traffic in locations where it is available, choose a time and day of the week; then convert the day of the week to one of the following dates from 1990:

-   Monday—1/1/1990
-   Tuesday—1/2/1990
-   Wednesday—1/3/1990
-   Thursday—1/4/1990
-   Friday—1/5/1990
-   Saturday—1/6/1990
-   Sunday—1/7/1990

Set the time and date as UNIX time in milliseconds. For example, to solve for 1:03 p.m. on Thursdays, set the time and date to 1:03 p.m., January 4, 1990, and convert to milliseconds (`631458180000` ). Although the dates representing days of the week are from 1990, typical traffic is calculated from recent traffic trends—usually over the last two years worth of data.

All facilities and incidents must be in the same time zone when you are doing any of the following:

-    Specifying a start time and traveling from incident to facility
-    Specifying an end time and traveling from facility to incident
-    Specifying a start time and traveling from facility to incident
-    Specifying an end time and traveling from incident to facility

#### Live traffic

To use live traffic when and where it is available, choose a time and date and convert to UNIX time.

Esri saves live traffic data for 1 hour and references predictive data extending 1 hour into the future. If the time and date you specify for this parameter is outside the 2-hour time window, or the travel time in the analysis continues past the predictive data window, the task returns to typical traffic speeds.

#### Examples for timeOfDay

Example 1: 13:03, January 4, 1990. Typical traffic on Thursdays at 1:03 p.m.

```javascript
"timeOfDay": 631458180000
```

 

Example 2: 17:00, January 7, 1990. Typical traffic on Sundays at 5:00 p.m.

```javascript
"timeOfDay": 631731600000
```

 

Example 3: Specify the `now`  value. The analysis begins at the current time and live traffic speeds are referenced in the analysis.

```javascript
"timeOfDay": now
```

 

Example 4: 10:20, March 18, 2015. If the current time is between 6:20 a.m., March 18, 2015, and 2:20 p.m., March 18, 2015, live traffic speeds are referenced in the analysis; otherwise, typical traffic speeds are referenced.

```javascript
"timeOfDay": 1426674000000
```

 

### timeOfDayIsUTC

Specify the time zone or zones of the `timeOfDay`  parameter.

The default value is `false` 

#### False (use geographically local time zones)

The `timeOfDay`  value refers to the time zone or zones in which the input points are located. This option causes the analysis to have rolling start times across time zones.

The following image illustrates setting the value to `false`  (geographically local). Setting `timeOfDay`  to 9:00 a.m., January 4, 1990 (631443600000 milliseconds) and `timeOfDayIsUTC`  to `false` , and submitting a valid request causes the drive times for points in the eastern time zone to start at 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. central time for points in the central time zone. (The start times are offset by an hour in real or UTC time.) 

![timeOfDayIsUTC set to false](../../shared/routing/images/TimeZoneForTimeOfDay_GeoLocal.png)

_Input: `timeOfDay`  is 9:00 a.m., January 4, 1990 (631443600000 milliseconds), and `timeOfDayIsUTC`  is set to `false` _

#### True (use UTC)

The `timeOfDay`  value refers to coordinated universal time (UTC). The start times for all points are simultaneous, regardless of time zones.

The following image illustrates setting the value to `true`  (UTC). Setting `timeOfDay`  to 9:00 a.m., January 4, 1990 (631443600000 milliseconds) and `timeOfDayIsUTC`  to `true`  causes the start time for points in the eastern time zone to be 4:00 a.m. eastern time and 3:00 a.m. central time for those in the central time zone.

![timeOfDayIsUTC set to true](../../shared/routing/images/TimeZoneForTimeOfDay_utc.png)

_Input: `timeOfDay`  is 9:00 a.m., January 4, 1990 (631443600000 milliseconds), and `timeOfDayIsUTC`  is set to `true` _

### timeOfDayUsage

The `timeOfDayUsage`  parameter value represents the arrival or departure time for the routes. This parameter can be specified using the following values:

-   `esriNATimeOfDayUseAsStartTime` —The service finds the best route considering the `timeOfDay`  parameter value as the departure time from the facility or incident.
-   `esriNATimeOfDayUseAsEndTime` —The service considers the `timeOfDay`  parameter value as the arrival time at the facility or incident. This value is useful if you want to know what time to depart from a location so that you arrive at the destination at the time specified in `timeOfDay` .

The default value for this parameter is `esriNATimeOfDayUseAsStartTime` . 

The parameter value is ignored if the `timeOfDay`  parameter value is `none` .

### useHierarchy

Specify whether hierarchy will be used when finding the shortest paths.

<Note type={"note"}>

The value of this parameter, regardless of whether you use the default or explicitly set a value, is overridden when you pass in `travelMode` . 

</Note>

-   `true` —Use hierarchy when travelling between facilities and incidents. When hierarchy is used, the service prefers higher-order streets (such as freeways) to lower-order streets (such as local roads) and can be used to simulate the driver preference of traveling on freeways instead of local roads even if that means a longer trip. This is especially true when finding routes to faraway locations, because drivers on long-distance trips tend to prefer traveling on freeways where stops, intersections, and turns can be avoided. Using hierarchy is computationally faster, especially for long-distance routes, since the service can determine the best route from a relatively smaller subset of streets.
-   `false` —Do not use hierarchy when travelling between facilities and incidents. When hierarchy is not used, the service considers all the streets and doesn't prefer higher-order streets when finding the route. This is often used when finding short-distance routes within a city.

The default value is `true` 

<Note type={"note"}>

The service automatically reverts to using hierarchy if the straight-line distance between the stops is greater than 50 miles (80.46 kilometers), even if you have specified to find the route without using hierarchy.

</Note>

### restrictUTurns

Use this parameter to restrict or permit the route from making U-turns at junctions.

<Note type={"caution"}>

The value of this parameter, regardless of whether you use the default or explicitly set a value, is overridden when you pass in `travelMode` . 

</Note>

To understand the available parameter values, a junction is a point where only two streets intersect each other. If three or more streets intersect at a point, it is called as an intersection. A cul-de-sac is a dead-end. This parameter can have the following values:

<StyledTable headers={"Parameter value,Description"}>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`esriNFSBAllowBacktrack` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

U-turns are permitted everywhere. Permitting U-turns implies that the vehicle can turn around at a junction and double back on the same street. 

![U-turns permitted](../../shared/routing/images/U-TurnsAtJunctions_Allowed.png)

_U-turns are permitted at junctions with any number of adjacent streets._

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`esriNFSBAtDeadEndsAndIntersections`

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`esriNFSBNoBacktrack` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

U-turns are prohibited at all junctions, intersections, and dead-ends. Even when this parameter value is chosen, a route can still make U-turns at stops. To prohibit U-turns at a stop, you can set its `CurbApproach`  property to the appropriate value (3).

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

</StyledTable>

The default value is `esriNFSBAllowBacktrack` 

### impedanceAttributeName

Specify the impedance.

<Note type={"note"}>

The value of this parameter, regardless of whether you use the default or explicitly set a value, is overridden when you pass in `travelMode` . 

</Note>

Impedance is a value that quantifies travel along the transportation network. Travel distance is an example of impedance; it quantifies the length of walkways and road segments. Similarly, drive time—the typical time it takes to drive a car along a road segment—is an example of impedance. Drive times may vary by type of vehicle—for instance, the time it takes for a truck to travel along a path tends to be longer than a car—so there can be many impedance values representing travel times for different vehicle types. Impedance values may also vary with time; live and typical traffic reference dynamic impedance values. Each walkway and road segment stores at least one impedance value. When performing a network analysis, the impedance values are used to calculate the best results, such as finding the shortest route—the route that minimizes impedance—between two points.

The `impedanceAttributeName`  parameter can be specified using the following values:

-   **TravelTime**—Historical and live traffic data is used. This option is good for modeling the time it takes automobiles to travel along roads at a specific time of day using live traffic speed data where available. When using **TravelTime**, you can optionally set the TravelTime::Vehicle Maximum Speed (km/h) attribute parameter to specify the physical limitation of the speed the vehicle is capable of traveling.
-   **Minutes**—Live traffic data is not used, but historical average speeds for automobiles data is used.
-   **TruckTravelTime**—Historical and live traffic data is used, but the speed is capped at the posted truck speed limit. This is good for modeling the time it takes for the trucks to travel along roads at a specific time. When using **TruckTravelTime**, you can optionally set the TruckTravelTime::Vehicle Maximum Speed (km/h) attribute parameter to specify the physical limitation of the speed the truck is capable of traveling.
-   **TruckMinutes**—Live traffic data is not used, but the smaller of the historical average speeds for automobiles and the posted speed limits for trucks are used.
-   **WalkTime**—The default is a speed of 5 km/hr on all roads and paths, but this can be configured through the WalkTime::Walking Speed (km/h) attribute parameter.
-   **Miles**—Length measurements along roads are stored in miles and can be used for performing analysis based on shortest distance.
-   **Kilometers**—Length measurements along roads are stored in kilometers and can be used for performing analysis based on shortest distance.

### accumulateAttributeNames

Use this parameter to specify whether the service will accumulate values other than the value specified for `impedanceAttributeName` . For example, if `impedanceAttributeName`  is set to `TravelTime` , the total travel time for the route will be calculated by the service. However, if you also want to calculate the total distance of the route in miles, you can specify `Miles`  as the value for the `accumulateAttributeNames`  parameter.

Specify the parameter value as a comma-separated list of names. The parameter values are the same as the `impedanceAttributeName`  parameter. For example, `accumulateAttributeNames=Miles,Kilometers`  indicates that the total cost of the route will also be calculated in miles and kilometers. 

<Note type={"note"}>

The values specified for the `accumulateAttributeNames`  parameter are for reference only. The service always uses `impedanceAttributeName`  to find the best routes.

</Note>

### restrictionAttributeNames

Use this parameter to specify the restrictions that will be honored by the service. A restriction represents a driving preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions cause roads or pathways to be prohibited, but they can also cause them to be avoided or preferred. For instance, using the `Avoid Toll  Roads`  restriction will result in a route that will include toll roads only when it is required to travel on toll roads to visit a stop. Use `Height Restriction`  to route around clearances that are lower than the height of the vehicle. If the vehicle is carrying corrosive materials, you can use the `Any Hazmat Prohibited`  restriction to prevent hauling the materials along roads where it is marked as illegal to do so.

<Note type={"note"}>

The value of this parameter, regardless of whether you use the default or explicitly set a value, is overridden when you pass in `travelMode` . 

</Note>

This parameter value is specified as a comma-separated list of restriction names. A value of none indicates that no restrictions will be used when finding the shortest paths. 

<Note type={"note"}>

Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries. If you specify restriction names that are not available in the country where the input points are located, the service ignores the invalid restrictions and returns warning messages indicating the names for the restrictions that were not considered when performing the analysis. 

</Note>

<Note type={"note"}>

You may need to specify an additional value, the restriction attribute parameter, for a restriction to get the intended results. This value must be associated with the restriction name and a restriction parameter using `attributeParameterValues` .

</Note>

The `restrictionAttributeNames`  parameter can be specified using the following values: 

-   Any Hazmat Prohibited—The results will not include roads where transporting any kind of hazardous material is prohibited. 
-   Avoid Carpool Roads—The results will avoid roads that are designated exclusively for car pool (high-occupancy) vehicles. 
-   Avoid Express Lanes—The results will avoid roads designated as express lanes. 
-   Avoid Ferries—The results will avoid ferries. 
-   Avoid Gates—The results will avoid roads where there are gates, such as keyed access or guard-controlled entryways.
-   Avoid Limited Access Roads—The results will avoid roads that are limited-access highways.
-   Avoid Private Roads—The results will avoid roads that are not publicly owned and maintained.
-   Avoid Roads Unsuitable for Pedestrians—The results will avoid roads that are unsuitable for pedestrians.
-   Avoid Stairways—The results will avoid all stairways on a pedestrian-suitable route.
-   Avoid Toll Roads—The results will avoid all toll roads for automobiles.
-   Avoid Toll Roads for Trucks—The results will avoid all toll roads for trucks.
-   Avoid Truck Restricted Roads—The results will avoid roads where trucks are not allowed, except when making deliveries.
-   Avoid Unpaved Roads—The results will avoid roads that are not paved (for example, dirt, gravel, and so on). 
-   Axle Count Restriction—The results will not include roads where trucks with the specified number of axles are prohibited. The number of axles can be specified using the Number of Axles restriction parameter.
-   Driving a Bus—The results will not include roads where buses are prohibited. Using this restriction will also ensure that the results will honor one-way streets. 
-   Driving a Taxi—The results will not include roads where taxis are prohibited. Using this restriction will also ensure that the results will honor one-way streets. 
-   Driving a Truck—The results will not include roads where trucks are prohibited. Using this restriction will also ensure that the results will honor one-way streets. 
-   Driving an Automobile—The results will not include roads where automobiles are prohibited. Using this restriction will also ensure that the results will honor one-way streets. 
-   Driving an Emergency Vehicle—The results will not include roads where emergency vehicles are prohibited. Using this restriction will also ensure that the results will honor one-way streets.
-   Height Restriction—The results will not include roads where the vehicle height exceeds the maximum allowed height for the road. The vehicle height can be specified using the Vehicle Height (meters) restriction parameter. 
-   Kingpin to Rear Axle Length Restriction—The results will not include roads where the vehicle length exceeds the maximum allowed kingpin to rear axle for all trucks on the road. The length between the vehicle kingpin and the rear axle can be specified using the Vehicle Kingpin to Rear Axle Length (meters) restriction parameter. 
-   Length Restriction—The results will not include roads where the vehicle length exceeds the maximum allowed length for the road. The vehicle length can be specified using the Vehicle Length (meters) restriction parameter. 
-   Preferred for Pedestrians—The results will use preferred routes suitable for pedestrian navigation. 
-   Riding a Motorcycle—The results will not include roads where motorcycles are prohibited. Using this restriction will also ensure that the results will honor one-way streets.
-   Roads Under Construction Prohibited—The results will not include roads that are under construction.
-   Semi or Tractor with One or More Trailers Prohibited—The results will not include roads where semis or tractors with one or more trailers are prohibited. 
-   Single Axle Vehicles Prohibited—The results will not include roads where vehicles with single axles are prohibited.
-   Tandem Axle Vehicles Prohibited—The results will not include roads where vehicles with tandem axles are prohibited.
-   Through Traffic Prohibited—The results will not include roads where through traffic (nonlocal traffic) is prohibited.
-   Truck with Trailers Restriction—The results will not include roads where trucks with the specified number of trailers on the truck are prohibited. The number of trailers on the truck can be specified using the Number of Trailers on Truck restriction parameter.
-   Use Preferred Hazmat Routes—The results will prefer roads that are designated for transporting hazardous materials. 
-   Use Preferred Truck Routes—The results will prefer roads that are designated as truck routes, such as roads that are part of the national network as specified by the National Surface Transportation Assistance Act in the United States, or roads that are designated as truck routes by the state or province, or roads that are preferred by truckers when driving in an area.
-   Walking—The results will not include roads where pedestrians are prohibited.
-   Weight Restriction—The results will not include roads where the vehicle weight exceeds the maximum allowed weight for the road. The vehicle weight can be specified using the Vehicle Weight (kilograms) restriction parameter.
-   Weight per Axle Restriction—The results will not include roads where the vehicle weight per axle exceeds the maximum allowed weight per axle for the road. The vehicle weight per axle can be specified using the Vehicle Weight per Axle (kilograms) restriction parameter.
-   Width Restriction—The results will not include roads where the vehicle width exceeds the maximum allowed width for the road. The vehicle width can be specified using the Vehicle Width (meters) restriction parameter.

The `Driving a Delivery Vehicle`  restriction attribute is no longer available. The service will ignore this restriction since it is invalid. To achieve similar results, use the `Driving a Truck`  restriction attribute along with the `Avoid Truck Restricted Roads`  restriction attribute.

The `restrictionAttributeName`  parameter value is specified as a list of restriction names. A value of `null`  indicates that no restrictions will be used when finding the best route, but only when `travelMode`  is set to `null` . 

### attributeParameterValues

Use this parameter to specify additional values required by an attribute or restriction, such as to specify whether the restriction prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on restricted roads. If the restriction is meant to avoid or prefer roads, you can further specify the degree to which they are avoided or preferred using this parameter. For example, you can choose to never use toll roads, avoid them as much as possible, or prefer them.

<Note type={"note"}>

The value of this parameter, regardless of whether you use the default or explicitly set a value, is overridden when you pass in `travelMode` . 

</Note>

This parameter value is specified as an array of objects each having the following properties:

-   `attributeName` —The name of the restriction.
-   `parameterName` —The name of the parameter associated with the restriction. A restriction can have one or more `parameterName`  properties.
-   `value` —The value for `parameterName` .

Most attribute parameters are related to the restriction attributes in `restrictionAttributeNames` . Each restriction has at least one attribute parameter named `Restriction Usage` , which specifies whether the restriction prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on the roads associated with the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or preferred. The `Restriction Usage`  parameter can be assigned any of the following string values or their equivalent numeric values in the parentheses:

-   `Prohibited`  (`-1` )—Travel on the roads that have the restriction is prohibited.
-   `Avoid_High`  (`5` )—It is very unlikely the service will include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.
-   `Avoid_Medium`  (`2` )—It is unlikely the service will include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.
-   `Avoid_Low`  (`1.3` )—It is somewhat unlikely the service will include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.
-   `Prefer_Low`  (`0.8` )—It is somewhat likely the service will include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.
-   `Prefer_Medium` (`0.5` )—It is likely the service will include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.
-   `Prefer_High`  (`0.2` )—It is very likely the service will include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.

<Note type={"note"}>

The `restrictionAttributeNames`  parameter is associated with `attributeParameterValues` . The restriction attribute's parameter value is specified as part of `attributeParameterValues` . Each restriction has at least one parameter named `Restriction Usage` , which specifies whether travel on roads that have the restriction is prohibited, should be avoided, or should be preferred. For the latter two options, it also specifies the degree to which the roads are avoided or preferred.

</Note>

The following table lists the attribute parameter names and the default parameter values.

<Note type={"tip"}>

To use the default value for a restriction, `attributeName` , `parameterName`  and `value`  do not need to be specified as part of the `attributeParameterValues`  parameter.

#### Syntax example for attributeParameterValues

```other
[
    {
        "attributeName": "<attribute1>",
        "parameterName": "<parameter1>",
        "value": "<value1>"
    },
    {
        "attributeName": "<attribute2>",
        "parameterName": "<parameter2>",
        "value": "<value2>"
    }
]
```

 

#### Example for attributeParameterValues

This example shows how to specify the height and weight of the vehicle for use with the height and weight restrictions, respectively, along with a high preference to include the designated truck routes. This results in a route that does not include roads where the clearance under overpasses or through tunnels is less than the vehicle height. The route will also not include roads with load-limited bridges or local roads that prohibit heavy vehicles if the vehicle weight exceeds the maximum permissible weight. However, the route will include as many roads as possible that are designated as preferred truck routes. 

The `Restriction Usage`  parameter for `Height Restriction`  and `Weight Restriction`  are not specified, as the default value of `Prohibit`  will be used for these restriction parameters. 

```other
attributeParameterValues=
[
    {
        "attributeName": "Height Restriction",
        "parameterName": "Vehicle Height (meters)",
        "value": 4.12
    },
    {
        "attributeName": "Weight Restriction",
        "parameterName": "Vehicle Weight (kilograms)",
        "value": 36287
    },
    {
        "attributeName": "Use Preferred Truck Routes",
        "parameterName": "Restriction Usage",
        "value": "Prefer_High"
    }
]
```

 

### barriers

Use this parameter to specify one or more points that will act as temporary restrictions or represent additional time or distance that may be required to travel on the underlying streets. For example, a point barrier can be used to represent a fallen tree along a street or a time delay spent at a railroad crossing.

<Note type={"note"}>

The service imposes a maximum limit of 250 point barriers. If this limit is exceeded, the response returns an error message.

</Note>

You can use a simple comma- and semicolon-based syntax if you are passing the point barrier locations using their longitude and latitude values in the WGS84 coordinate system and don't need to pass additional fields for each location.

```

 

You can specify barrier geometries as well as attributes using a more comprehensive JSON structure that references a set of features. The property is optional; however, the JSON structure must specify either the `url`  or `features`  property: 

-   `url` —Specify a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set. 

    The JSON structure can include the following property: 

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .
-   `features` —Specify an array of features. 

    Each feature in this array represents a point barrier and contains the following fields:

    -   `geometry` —Specify the input point geometry containing `x`  and `y`  properties along with the `spatialReference`  property. If the `spatialReference`  property is defined for the entire JSON, you don't need to define this property for each geometry. Doing so reduces the size of the input JSON if the input has many features and improves performance. This property is not required if the coordinates are in the default spatial reference, WGS84. If the coordinates are in a different spatial reference, you must specify the spatial reference's well-known ID (WKID). See [Using spatial references](DEVSITE/rest/services-reference/enterprise/using-spatial-references) to look up WKID values.

        <Note type={"tip"}>

        It is recommended that you explicitly specify the `spatialReference`  value, and specify it for the entire JSON rather than each individual geometry. 

        </Note>
    -   `attributes` —Specify each attribute as a key-value pair in which the key is the name of a given field, and the value is the attribute value for the corresponding field.

    The JSON structure can include the following property:

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .

#### Attribute for barriers

When specifying the `barriers`  parameter using JSON structure, you can specify additional information about barriers—such as the barrier type—using attributes. The `barriers`  parameter can be specified with the following attributes:

`Name` 

The name of the barrier.

`ObjectID` 

The object ID of the barrier. `ObjectID`  is a unique identifier for the barrier. If you want to maintain a relationship between the input and output, set `preserveObjectID`  to `true` . The `ObjectID`  value of the input barrier is included in the output barrier (as the `ObjectID`  field) and can be used to join additional information from analysis outputs to the attribute of the barriers. If the `ObjectID`  value is not specified, a unique ID is automatically generated in the output.

`BarrierType` 

Specifies whether the point barrier restricts travel completely or adds time or distance when it is crossed. The value for this attribute is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):

-   0 (Restriction)—Prohibits travel through the barrier. The barrier is referred to as a restriction point barrier since it acts as a restriction.

    ![Two maps demonstrate how a restriction point barrier affects a route analysis.](../../shared/routing/images/Point_Barriers.png)

    _The first map shows the shortest path between two stops without any restriction point barriers. The second map has a road that is blocked by a fallen tree, so the shortest path between the same points is longer._
-   2 (Added Cost)—Traveling through the barrier increases the travel time or distance by the amount specified in the `Attr_TravelTime` , `Attr_Miles` , `Attr_Kilometers` , `Attr_Minutes` , `Attr_WalkTime` , `Attr_TruckMinutes` , and `Attr_TruckTravelTime`  attributes. This barrier type is referred to as an added cost point barrier.

    ![Two maps demonstrate how added cost point barriers affect a route analysis.](../../shared/routing/images/nac_barriers_apoint.png)

    _The first map shows the shortest path between two stops without any added cost point barrier. For the second map, the travel time from stop 1 to stop 2 is the same whether going around the north end of the block or the south end; however, since crossing railroad tracks incurs a time penalty (modeled with added cost point barriers), the route with only one railroad crossing is chosen. The cost of crossing the barrier is added to the accumulated travel time of the resulting route._

<Note type={"note"}>

There is no point barrier type with a value of 1 for the `BarrierType`  attribute.

</Note>

`FullEdge` 

Specifies how the restriction point barriers are applied to the edge elements during the analysis. The field value is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses): 

-   0 (False)—Permits travel on the edge up to the barrier but not through it. This is the default value.
-   1 (True)—Restricts travel anywhere on the associated edge.

`Attr_[Cost]` 

Indicates how the cost (time or distance) is added when the barrier is traversed. This attribute is applicable only for added cost point barriers. The attribute value must be greater than or equal to zero.

`Attr_[Cost]`  is only referenced when the cost attribute referred to in the field name is used in the analysis as impedance or accumulate attribute.

See the [list of cost attributes](/closest-facility-synchronous-service#impedanceattributename) supported by the service.

#### Examples for barriers

Example 1: Specify an added cost point barrier using JSON structure

This example shows how to use an added cost point barrier to model a five-minute delay at a railroad crossing. The `BarrierType`  attribute is used to specify that the point barrier is of type added cost and the `Attr_TravelTime`  attribute is used to specify the delay in minutes. 

```other
{
  "spatialReference": {
    "wkid": 4326
  },
  "features": [
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -122.053461,

        "Attr_TravelTime": 5
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

 

Example 2: Specify a restriction point barrier using a URL

The URL makes a query for a few features from a map service. A URL querying features from a feature service can also be specified.

```javascript
{
    "url": "https://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Network/USA/MapServer/0/query?where=1%3D1&returnGeometry=true&f=json"
}
```

 

### polylineBarriers

Use this parameter to specify one or more lines that prohibit travel anywhere the lines intersect the streets. For example, a parade or protest that blocks traffic across several street segments can be modeled with a line barrier. A line barrier can also quickly fence off several roads from being traversed, thereby channeling possible routes away from undesirable parts of the street network.

![Two maps demonstrate how a line barrier affects finding a route between two stops.](../../shared/routing/images/Polyline_Barriers.png)

_The first map displays the shortest path between two stops. The second map shows the shortest path when several streets are blocked by a polyline barrier._

You can specify polyline barrier geometries as well as attributes using a JSON structure that references a set of features. The property is optional; however, the JSON structure must specify either the `url`  or `features`  property: 

-   `url` —Specify a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set. 

    The JSON structure can include the following property: 

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .
-   `features` —Specify an array of features. 

    Each feature in this array represents a polyline barrier and contains the following fields:

    -   `geometry` —Specify the input point geometry containing `x`  and `y`  properties along with the `spatialReference`  property. If the `spatialReference`  property is defined for the entire JSON, you don't need to define this property for each geometry. Doing so reduces the size of the input JSON if the input has many features and improves performance. This property is not required if the coordinates are in the default spatial reference, WGS84. If the coordinates are in a different spatial reference, you must specify the spatial reference's well-known ID (WKID). See [Using spatial references](DEVSITE/rest/services-reference/enterprise/using-spatial-references) to look up WKID values.

        <Note type={"tip"}>

        It is recommended that you explicitly specify the `spatialReference`  value, and specify it for the entire JSON rather than each individual geometry. 

        </Note>
    -   `attributes` —Specify each attribute as a key-value pair in which the key is the name of a given field, and the value is the attribute value for the corresponding field.

    The JSON structure can include the following property:

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .

#### Attributes for polylineBarriers

When specifying the `polylineBarriers`  parameter using JSON structure, the parameter can be specified with the following attribute:

`Name` 

The name of the barrier.

`ObjectID` 

The object ID of the line barrier. `ObjectID`  is a unique identifier for the line barrier. If you want to maintain a relationship between the input and output, set `preserveObjectID`  to `true` . The `ObjectID`  value of the input line barrier is included in the output line barrier (as the `ObjectID`  field) and can be used to join additional information from analysis outputs to the attribute of the line barriers. If the `ObjectID`  value is not specified, a unique ID is automatically generated in the output.

### polygonBarriers

Use this parameter to specify polygons that either completely restrict travel or proportionately scale the time or distance required to travel on the streets intersected by the polygons.

You can specify polygon barrier geometries as well as attributes using a JSON structure that references a set of features. The property is optional; however, the JSON structure must specify either the `url`  or `features`  property: 

-   `url` —Specify a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set. 

    The JSON structure can include the following property: 

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .
-   `features` —Specify an array of features. 

    Each feature in this array represents a polygon barrier and contains the following fields:

    -   `geometry` —Specify the input point geometry containing `x`  and `y`  properties along with the `spatialReference`  property. If the `spatialReference`  property is defined for the entire JSON, you don't need to define this property for each geometry. Doing so reduces the size of the input JSON if the input has many features and improves performance. This property is not required if the coordinates are in the default spatial reference, WGS84. If the coordinates are in a different spatial reference, you must specify the spatial reference's well-known ID (WKID). See [Using spatial references](DEVSITE/rest/services-reference/enterprise/using-spatial-references) to look up WKID values.

        <Note type={"tip"}>

        It is recommended that you explicitly specify the `spatialReference`  value, and specify it for the entire JSON rather than each individual geometry. 

        </Note>
    -   `attributes` —Specify each attribute as a key-value pair in which the key is the name of a given field, and the value is the attribute value for the corresponding field.

    The JSON structure can include the following property:

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .

#### Attributes for polygonBarriers

When specifying the `polygonBarriers`  parameter using JSON structure, you can specify additional information about barriers—such as the barrier type—using attributes. The `polygonBarriers`  parameter can be specified with the following attributes:

`Name` 

The name of the barrier.

`ObjectID` 

The object ID of the polygon barrier. `ObjectID`  is a unique identifier for the polygon barrier. If you want to maintain a relationship between the input and output, set `preserveObjectID`  to `true` . The `ObjectID`  value of the input polygon barrier is included in the output polygon barrier (as the `ObjectID`  field) and can be used to join additional information from analysis outputs to the attribute of the polygon barriers. If the `ObjectID`  value is not specified, a unique ID is automatically generated in the output.

`BarrierType` 

Use this parameter to specify polygons that either completely restrict travel or proportionately scale the time or distance required to travel on the streets intersected by the polygons.

-   0 (Restriction)—Prohibits traveling through any part of the barrier. The barrier is referred to as a restriction polygon barrier since it prohibits traveling on streets intersected by the barrier. One use of this type of barrier is to model floods covering areas of the street that make traveling on those streets impossible.

    This is the default value.

    ![Two maps demonstrate how a restriction polygon barrier affects finding a route between two stops.](../../shared/routing/images/Polygon_Barriers.png)

    _The first map depicts the shortest path between two stops. The second map shows a polygon barrier blocking flooded streets, so the shortest path between the same two stops is different._
-   1 (Scaled Cost)—Scales the time or distance required to travel the underlying streets by a factor specified using the `Attr_TravelTime` , `Attr_Miles` , `Attr_Kilometers` , `Attr_Minutes` , `Attr_WalkTime` , `Attr_TruckMinutes` , or `Attr_TruckTravelTime`  attributes. If the streets are partially covered by the barrier, the travel time or distance is apportioned and then scaled. For example, a factor of 0.25 means that travel on underlying streets is expected to be four times faster than normal. A factor of 3.0 means that it is expected to take three times longer than normal to travel on underlying streets. This barrier type is referred to as a scaled cost polygon barrier. It can be used to model storms that reduce travel speeds in specific regions, for example. 

    ![Two maps demonstrate how a scaled cost polygon barrier affects finding a route between two stops.](../../shared/routing/images/nac_barriers_spolygon.png)

    _The first map shows a route that goes through inclement weather without regard for the effect that poor road conditions have on travel time. The second map shows a scaled polygon barrier that doubles the travel time of the roads covered by the storm. The route still passes through the southern tip of the storm, since it is quicker to spend more time driving slowly through a small part of the storm rather than driving completely around it. The service uses the modified travel time in calculating the best route, and the modified travel time is reported as the total travel time in the response._

`Attr_[Cost]` 

This is the factor by which the cost of the streets intersected by the barrier is multiplied. This attribute is applicable only for scaled cost barriers. The attribute value must be greater than zero. 

`Attr_[Cost]`  is only referenced when it is used in the analysis as impedance or accumulate attribute.

#### Examples for polygonBarriers

Example 1: Specify a polygon barrier using JSON structure

This example shows how to add two polygons as barriers. The first polygon, Flood zone, is a restriction polygon barrier that prohibits travel on the underlying streets. The polygon is a single-part polygon feature composed of four points. The second polygon, Severe weather zone, is a scaled-cost polygon barrier that reduces the travel time on underlying streets to one-third of the original value. The polygon is a two-part polygon feature. Both parts are composed of four points.

}
```

 

### returnDirections

Specify whether the service will generate driving directions for each route.

The default value is `false` .

-   `true` —Generate directions. The directions are configured based on the values for the `directionsLanguage` , `directionsOutputType` , `directionsStyleName` , and `directionsLengthUnits`  parameters. The directions are available in the `directions`  property of the JSON response.
-   `false` —Don't generate directions.

### directionsLanguage

The language that will be used when generating travel directions. 

This parameter applies only when the `returnDirections`  parameter is set to `true` . The service supports generating directions in the following languages: 

-   `ar` —Arabic

-   `th` —Thai
-   `tr` —Turkish
-   `uk` —Ukrainian
-   `vi` —Vietnamese
-   `zh-CN` —Chinese (China)
-   `zh-HK` —Chinese (Hong Kong) 
-   `zh-TW` —Chinese (Taiwan) 

The service tries to find an exact match for the specified language including any language localization. If an exact match is not found, it tries to match the language family. If a match is still not found, the service returns the directions using the default language, English. For example, if the directions language is specified as `es-MX`  (Mexican Spanish), the service will return the directions in Spanish as it supports `es`  language code and not `es-MX` .

<Note type={"caution"}>

If a language supports localization, such as Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) and European Portuguese (pt-PT), specify the language family and the localization. If you only specify the language family, the service will not match the language family and instead return directions in the default language, English. For example, if the directions language is specified as `pt` , the service will return the directions in the default language, English since it cannot decide if the directions should be returned in `pt-BR`  or `pt-PT` . 

</Note>

### directionsOutputType

Define the content and verbosity of the driving directions. This parameter applies only when the `returnDirections`  parameter is set to `true` . This parameter can be specified using the following values: 

-   `esriDOTComplete` —The directions output includes all directions properties.
-   `esriDOTCompleteNoEvents` —The directions output includes all directions properties except events.
-   `esriDOTInstructionsOnly` —The directions output includes text instructions, time, length and ETA. The directions do not include geometry.
-   `esriDOTStandard` —The directions output includes text instructions, time, length, ETA, and geometry. The directions do not include events, new types of strings (street names, signposts information), maneuver type, bearings, or turn angle.
-   `esriDOTSummaryOnly` —The directions output contains a summary (time and length). Detailed text instructions and geometry are not included.
-   `esriDOTFeatureSets` —The directions output includes two feature sets: direction points and direction lines. The direction points set contains point features representing the direction maneuvers such as arriving to or departing from a stop, turning left or right, and other events along the route. This feature set also contains the route's turn-by-turn directions. The direction lines set contains line features for each segment of the route. This feature set can be used to visualize the turn-by-turn directions on a map. 

The default value is `esriDOTStandard` .

### directionsStyleName

Specify the name of the formatting style for the directions. This parameter can be specified using the following values: 

-   `NA Desktop` —Generates turn-by-turn directions suitable for printing. 
-   `NA Navigation` —Generates turn-by-turn directions designed for an in-vehicle navigation device.
-   `NA Campus` —Generates turn-by-turn walking directions designed for pedestrian routes.

The default value is `NA Desktop` .

This parameter applies only when the `returnDirections`  parameter is set to `true` .

### directionsLengthUnits

Specify the units for displaying travel distance in the driving directions. This parameter applies only when the `returnDirections`  parameter is set to `true` . This parameter can be specified using the following values: 

-   `esriNAUFeet` 
-   `esriNAUKilometers` 
-   `esriNAUMeters` 
-   `esriNAUMiles` 
-   `esriNAUNauticalMiles` 
-   `esriNAUYards` 

The default value is `esriNAUMiles` . 

### directionsTimeAttributeName

Set the time-based impedance attribute to display the duration of a maneuver, such as "Go northwest on Alvarado St. for 5 minutes." The units for all the time attributes is minutes.

-   `TravelTime` —Travel time for a car
-   `Minutes` —Travel time for a car without using live traffic data
-   `TruckTravelTime` —Travel time for a truck
-   `TruckMinutes` —Travel time for a truck without using live traffic data
-   `WalkTime` —Travel time for a pedestrian

The default value is `TravelTime` .

### outputLines

Use this parameter to specify the type of route features that are output by the service. This parameter is applicable only if the `returnCFRoutes`  parameter is set to `true` . The `outputLines`  parameter can have one of the following values: 

-   `esriNAOutputLineTrueShape` —Return the exact shape of the resulting route that is based on the underlying streets. 

    This is the default value.
-   `esriNAOutputLineTrueShapeWithMeasure` —Return the exact shape of the resulting route that is based on the underlying streets and include route measurements that keep track of the cumulative travel time or travel distance along the route relative to the first stop. When this value is chosen for the `outputLines`  parameter, each point in the route shape will include an m-value along with an x-value and a y-value. The m-value, also known as the measure value, indicates the accumulated travel time or travel distance at that point along the route. The m-values can be used to determine how far you have traveled from the start of the route or the remaining distance or time left to reach the destination. The m-values are in the same units as the impedance attribute.
-   `esriNAOutputLineStraight` —Return a straight line between the incident and the closest facility.
-   `esriNAOutputLineNone` —Do not return any shapes for the routes. This value can be useful when you are only interested in determining the total travel time or travel distance of the route. For example, if the application has calculated the route and after some time it will calculate the estimated time of arrival (ETA) to the destination, you can set the `returnCFRoutes`  parameter to `true`  and the `outputLines`  parameter to `esriNAOutputLineNone` . The `routes`  property of the JSON response will only contain the total travel time that can be used to determine the ETA. Since the route shape is not returned when using the `esriNAOutputLineNone`  value, the response size will be considerably smaller.

<Note type={"note"}>

When the `outputLines`  parameter is set to `esriNAOutputLineTrueShape`  or `esriNAOutputLineTrueShapeWithMeasure` , the generalization of the route shape can be further controlled using the appropriate values for the `outputGeometryPrecision`  and `outputGeometryPrecisionUnits`  parameters. 

</Note>

<Note type={"note"}>

Regardless of the value you choose for the `outputLines`  parameter, the best route is always determined by minimizing the travel time or the travel distance, never using the Euclidean distance (or as-the-crow-flies distance) between the stops. This means that only the route shapes are different, not the underlying streets that are searched when finding the route.

</Note>

### returnFacilities

Use this parameter to specify whether facilities will be returned by the service. The possible values for this parameter are `true`  or `false` . A `true`  value indicates that the facilities used as input will be returned as part of the `facilities`  property in the JSON response. The default value for this parameter is `false` . 

If you specified the `facilities`  parameter value using a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set, you can set the `returnFacilities`  parameter to `true`  so you can draw the facility locations in the application. You can also set the `returnFacilities`  property to `true`  to determine whether the facilities were successfully located on the street network or had other errors by reviewing the `Status`  property in the JSON response. 

### returnIncidents

Use this parameter to specify whether incidents will be returned by the service. The possible values for this parameter are `true`  or `false` . A `true`  value indicates that the incidents used as input will be returned as part of the `facilities`  property in the JSON response. The default value for this parameter is `false` . 

If you specified the `incidents`  parameter value using a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set, you can set the `returnIncidents`  parameter to `true`  so you can draw the incident locations in the application. You can also set the `returnIncidents`  property to `true`  to determine whether the incidents were successfully located on the street network or had other errors by reviewing the `Status`  property in the JSON response. 

### returnBarriers

Specify whether barriers will be returned by the service.

-   `true` —The input point barriers are returned as part of the `barriers`  property in the JSON response.
-   `false` —Point barriers are not returned. This is the default.

For this parameter to take effect, you must also specify a value for the `barriers`  parameter.

If you specified the `barriers`  parameter value using a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set, you can set the `returnBarriers`  parameter to `true`  so you can draw the point barrier locations in the application. You can also set the `returnBarriers`  property to `true`  to see where the barriers were located on the street network or, if they weren't located, understand what the problem was by reviewing the `Status`  property in the JSON response.

### returnPolylineBarriers

Specify whether polyline barriers will be returned by the service. 

-   `true` —The input polyline barriers are returned as part of the `polylineBarriers`  property in the JSON response.
-   `false` —Polyline barriers are not returned. This is the default.

For this parameter to take effect, you must also specify a value for the `polylineBarriers`  parameter.

If you specified the `polylineBarriers`  parameter value using a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set, you can set the `returnPolylineBarriers`  parameter to `true`  so you can draw the polyline barrier locations in the application. 

### returnPolygonBarriers

Specify whether polygon barriers will be returned by the service. 

-   `true` —The input polygon barriers are returned as part of the `polygonBarriers`  property in the JSON response.
-   `false` —Polygon barriers are not returned. This is the default.

For this parameter to take effect, you must also specify a value for the `polygonBarriers`  parameter.

If you specified the `polygonBarriers`  parameter value using a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set, you can set the `returnPolygonBarriers`  parameter to `true`  so you can draw the polygon barrier locations in the application. 

### returnTraversedEdges

Specify whether traversed edges will be returned by the service. 

-   `true` —The traversed edges are returned as part of the JSON response.
-   `false` —The traversed edges are not returned.

When this parameter is set to `true` , the traversed edges are available in the `traversedEdges`  property of the JSON response.

The default value is `false` 

### returnTraversedJunctions

Specify whether traversed junctions will be returned by the service. 

-   `true` —The traversed junctions are returned as part of the JSON response.
-   `false` —The traversed junctions are not returned.

When this parameter is set to `true` , the traversed junctions are available in the `traversedJunctions`  property of the JSON response.

The default value is `false` 

### returnTraversedTurns

Specify whether traversed turns will be returned by the service. 

-   `true` —The traversed turns are returned as part of the JSON response.
-   `false` —The traversed turns are not returned.

When this parameter is set to `true` , the traversed turns are available in the `traversedTurns`  property of the JSON response.

The default value is `false` 

### ignoreInvalidLocations

Specifies whether invalid input locations will be ignored. 

-   `true` —

    Network locations that are unlocated will be ignored and the analysis will run using valid network locations only. The analysis will also continue if locations are on nontraversable elements or have other errors. This is useful if you know the network locations are not all correct, but you want to run the analysis with the network locations that are valid. This is the default.
-   `false` —

    Invalid locations will not be ignored. Do not run the analysis if there are invalid locations. Correct the invalid locations and rerun the analysis.

### outSR

Use this parameter to specify the spatial reference of the geometries, such as line or point features, returned by the service.

The parameter value can be specified as a well-known ID (WKID) for the spatial reference. See [Using spatial references](DEVSITE/rest/services-reference/enterprise/using-spatial-references) to look up WKID values.

Many of the basemaps provided by ArcGIS Online are in the Web Mercator spatial reference (WKID 102100). Specifying `outSR=102100`  returns the geometries in the Web Mercator spatial reference, which can be drawn on top of the basemaps. 

### outputGeometryPrecision

Use this parameter to specify the simplification level for the route geometry returned by the service. 

<Note type={"caution"}>

The value of this parameter, regardless of whether you use the default or explicitly set a value, is overridden when you pass in `travelMode` . 

</Note>

Simplification maintains critical points on a route, such as turns at intersections, to define the essential shape of the route and removes other points. The simplification distance you specify is the maximum allowable offset that the simplified line can deviate from the original line. Simplifying a line reduces the number of vertices that are part of the route geometry. This reduces the overall response size and also improves the performance for drawing the route shapes in the applications.

The default value for this parameter is 10.

The units are specified using the `outputGeometryPrecisionUnits`  parameter.

### outputGeometryPrecisionUnits

Use this parameter to specify the units for the `outputGeometryPrecision`  parameter value. 

<Note type={"caution"}>

The value of this parameter, regardless of whether you use the default or explicitly set a value, is overridden when you pass in `travelMode` . 

</Note>

Specify the value as one of the following: 

-   `esriCentimeters` 
-   `esriDecimalDegrees` 
-   `esriDecimeters` 
-   `esriFeet` 
-   `esriInches` 
-   `esriKilometers` 
-   `esriMeters` 
-   `esriMiles` 
-   `esriMillimeters` 
-   `esriNauticalMiles` 
-   `esriPoints` 
-   `esriYards` 

The default value is `esriMeters` .

### geometryPrecision

Use this parameter to specify the number of decimal places that will be used in the response geometries returned by the solve operation. This applies to x- and y-values only (not m- or z-values).

```javascript
geometryPrecision = 3
```

 

### geometryPrecisionM

Use this parameter to specify the number of decimal places that will be used in the response geometries returned by the solve operation. This applies to m-values only (not x-, y-, or z-values).

```javascript
geometryPrecisionM = 3
```

 

### overrides

<Note type={"note"}>

This parameter is for internal use only.

</Note>

### preserveObjectID

Use this parameter to specify whether the object IDs specified for input locations such as facilities, incidents, or barriers will be preserved when the input locations are returned as output. This can be useful if you want to associate additional attributes with the output locations after the solve operation is successful and need a common key field to do the join.

For example, this applies if your input incidents are specified as the following JSON representation of a feature set:

```javascript
{
  "spatialReference": {
    "wkid": 4326
  },
  "features": [
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -122.4079,
        "y": 37.78356
      },
      "attributes": {
        "ObjectID": 10,
        "Name": "Fire Incident 1"
      }
    },
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -122.404,
        "y": 37.782
      },
      "attributes": {
        "ObjectID": 20,
        "Name": "Crime Incident 45"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

 

And your input facilities are specified as the following JSON representation of a feature set:

```javascript
{
  "spatialReference": {
    "wkid": 4326
  },
  "features": [
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -122.4079,
        "y": 37.78356
      },
      "attributes": {
        "ObjectID": 30,
        "Name": "Fire Station 34"
      }
    },
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -122.404,
        "y": 37.782
      },
      "attributes": {
        "ObjectID": 40,
        "Name": "Fire Station 29"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

 

If you solve a closest facility and specify `preserveObjectID=false` , the output incidents will have object IDs, 1, 2, and the output facilities will have object IDs, 1, 2, even though the input incidents have object IDs 10, 20, and the input facilities have object IDs 30, 40. However if `preserveObjectID=true` , the output incidents and facilities will preserve the `ObjectID`  from inputs.

<Note type={"note"}>

The order in which the output locations are returned varies based on other parameters specified for the solve operation and should not be relied upon to correlate the output locations with input locations. Preserving the object ID is the best way to achieve this correlation. If the identifier for the input location can not be passed as an `ObjectID`  value, for example, the identifier is not numeric, you can pass the identifier as the `Name`  field and use the `Name`  field on the output locations to correlate the input and output locations.

</Note>

<Note type={"note"}>

When `preserveObjectID=true` , the object ID values must be 1 or greater, must be specified for every feature, and must be unique.

</Note>

### returnEmptyResults

Specify whether the service will return empty results instead of the error property when the request fails.

-   `true` —The JSON response doesn't contain the error property when the request fails. All errors are returned in the messages property. The response JSON may contain an empty feature set or empty result for the properties you requested.
-   `false` —The JSON response only contains the error property when the request fails.

The default value is `false` .

Typically when a request fails, the service will return a JSON response that contains the error property. In some cases, you might want to set `returnEmptyResults`  to `true`  so it always returns properties you requested instead of returning an error response to help handle the response in a more consistent way. 

Even if the request fails, when you set `returnEmptyResults = true` , `returnFacilities = true`  and `returnIncidents = true` , you can return facilities and incidents to investigate why some of them failed to locate.

### locateSettings

Use this parameter to specify settings that affect how inputs are located, such as the maximum search distance to use when locating the inputs on the network or the network sources being used for locating.

[Learn more about locating inputs](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/3.2/help/analysis/networks/locating-analysis-inputs.htm)

The parameter value is specified as a JSON object. The JSON object allows you to specify a locator JSON for all input feature in the analysis, or you can specify an override for a particular input. The override allows you to have different settings for each analysis input. 					When specifying the `locateSettings`  JSON, you must provide all the properties including `tolerance` , `toleranceUnits` , `sources` , and `allowAutoRelocate`  in the default locator JSON object. If you need to provide a different locator JSON for a particular input class, you must include the overrides property for that input. The property name must match the input parameter name. The locator JSON for a particular input doesn't need to include all the properties; you only need to include the properties that are different from the default locator JSON properties.

The default value is as follows:

```javascript
{
  "default": {
    "tolerance": 20000,
    "toleranceUnits": "esriMeters",
    "allowAutoRelocate": true,
    "sources": [
      {
        "name": "main.Routing_Streets"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

 

The locator JSON object has following properties:

-   `tolerance`  and `toleranceUnits` —Allows you to control the maximum search distance when locating inputs. If no valid network location is found within this distance, the input features will be considered unlocated. A small search tolerance decreases the likelihood of locating on the wrong street but increases the likelihood of not finding any valid network location. The `toleranceUnits`  parameter value can be specified as one of the following values:

    -   `esriCentimeters` 
    -   `esriDecimalDegrees` 
    -   `esriDecimeters` 
    -   `esriFeet` 
    -   `esriInches` 
    -   `esriIntFeet` 
    -   `esriIntInches` 
    -   `esriIntMiles` 
    -   `esriIntNauticalMiles` 
    -   `esriIntYards` 
    -   `esriKilometers` 
    -   `esriMeters` 
    -   `esriMiles` 
    -   `esriMillimeters` 
    -   `esriNauticalMiles` 
    -   `esriYards` 
-   `sources` — Allows you to control which network source can be used for locating. For example, you can configure the analysis to locate inputs on streets but not on sidewalks. The list of possible sources on which to locate is specific to the network dataset this service references. Only the sources that are present in the sources array are used for locating. Sources is specified as an array of objects each having the following property:

    -   `name` —The name of the network source feature class that can be used for locating inputs
-   `allowAutoRelocate` —Allows you to control whether inputs with existing network location fields can be automatically relocated when solving to ensure valid, routable location fields for the analysis. If the value is `true` , points located on restricted network elements and points affected by barriers will be relocated to the closest routable location. If the value is `false` , network location fields will be used as is even if the points are unreachable, and this may cause the solve to fail. Even if the value is `false` , inputs with no location fields or incomplete location fields will be located during the solve operation.

<Note type={"note"}>

Currently, you can't specify different source names for the `sources`  array. Also, `allowAutoRelocate`  is always set to `true`  since the service does not support location fields. 

</Note>

#### Syntax for locateSettings

Syntax for specifying `locateSettings`  using JSON structure

  }
}
```

 

#### Example for locateSettings

Example 1: Specify default locate settings using JSON structure

This example shows how to specify locate settings so inputs are located within 500 meters of the specified location. A small search tolerance like this can be valuable if you are solving using a walking travel mode and don't want inputs to be located farther than 500 meters from the original point location.

```javascript
{
  "default": {
    "tolerance": 500,
    "toleranceUnits": "esriMeters",
    "allowAutoRelocate": true,
    "sources": [
      {
        "name": "main.Routing_Streets"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

 

## JSON response

The JSON response from the Closest Facility service is based on the following syntax. The actual properties returned in the response depend upon the request parameters. For example, the `routes`  property is returned only if the `returnCFRoutes`  parameter is set to `true` . If a request fails, the JSON response only contains the `error`  property. The examples in the subsequent section illustrate the response returned with specific request parameters.

### Finding closest fire stations

This example shows how to find the two fire stations that can provide the quickest response to a fire at a given incident location within three minutes. You will also generate routes and driving directions for the firefighters.

Specify the four fire stations in the area as the `facilities`  parameter. Use the JSON structure to specify the facilities parameter, as you want to specify the name of the fire station that can be used by the service when generating driving directions for the routes from the fire stations. The geometries are in the default spatial reference WGS84. Therefore, the spatialReference property is not specified. 

Specify the longitude and latitude value for the fire location as the `incidents`  parameter. 

Since you need to find the two closest fire stations, specify `2`  as the value for the `defaultTargetFacilityCount`  parameter. To model the fire engines traveling from the stations to the fire (incident), specify `esriNATravelDirectionFromFacility`  as the value for the `travelDirection`  parameter. You need to search for fire stations that are within three minutes of the fire, so specify `3`  as the value for the `defaultCutoff`  parameter. Any fire stations outside the cutoff time are ignored by the service.

Because you need to generate driving directions and report the distance information within the directions in miles, specify the `returnDirections`  parameter as `true`  and the `directionsLengthUnits`  parameter as `esriNAUMiles` . To get the route geometries, specify the `returnCFRoutes`  parameter as `true` . Specify `102100`  as the value for the `outSR`  parameter so that the output routes are returned in the Web Mercator spatial reference and can be displayed on top of an ArcGIS Online basemap.

#### JSON response

The response contains two route features representing the best route to travel from the two closest fire stations to the incident. The response includes the `routes`  and `directions`  properties because the `returnCFRoutes`  and `returnDirections`  parameters are set to `true`  in the request. 

<Note type={"note"}>

Because the response is quite verbose, the repeated elements within the response are abbreviated for clarity.
