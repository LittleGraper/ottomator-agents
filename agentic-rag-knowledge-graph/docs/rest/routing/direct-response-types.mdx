## SolveRoutesResults

The JSON response from the route service is based on the following syntax. The actual properties returned in the response depend on the request parameters. For example, the `stops`  property is returned only if the `returnStops`  parameter is set to `true` . If a request fails, the JSON response only contains the `error`  property.

## Response objects

### saPolygons

It provides access to polygon features that represent areas that can be reached from the input locations with a given travel time, travel distance, or travel cost. 

This data type supports the fields described below. In addition to these fields, the data type also includes all the fields from the input feature class used as facilities for the analysis when generating overlapping or nonoverlapping polygons.

<StyledTable headers={"Field,Description"}>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`ObjectID` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The system-managed ID field.

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`FacilityID` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The unique identifier of the associated facility. 

If you specify `preserveObjectID=false` , the value for this field will be a system-generated ID. If `preserveObjectID=True` , the value for this field will be the ObjectID of your associated input.

Multiple facilities can be associated with one service area when the `geometryAtOverlap`  property of the analysis object is set to `ServiceAreaOverlapGeometry.Dissolve` ; therefore, `FacilityID`  field values are set to null when service areas are merged.

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`Name` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The name of the service area. It is based on the name of the associated facility and the cutoffs; for example, `Store1: 0.0 – 5.0`  represents a service area that covers all traversable streets within five minutes of a facility named `Store1` .

The break values are returned without the name of the facility, for example, `0.0 – 5.0` , when the `geometryAtOverlap`  property of the analysis object is set to `ServiceAreaOverlapGeometry.Dissolve` .

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`FromBreak` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The lower bound of the service area's impedance cutoff range. The unit for this field is based on the unit of the impedance attribute set for the analysis. 

If the impedance attribute is time based, the value is in the units specified by the `timeUnits`  property. If the impedance attribute is distance based, the value is in the units specified by the `distanceUnits`  property. The value is in unknown units if the impedance attribute is neither time based nor distance based.

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`ToBreak` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The upper bound of the service area's impedance cutoff range. The value is in the same units as the `FromBreak`  field values.

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

</StyledTable>

### saPolylines

This stores the resultant service areas as linear features and covers the streets, or network edges, that can be reached within the given time, distance, or other travel-cost cutoff. Lines are a truer representation of a service area than polygons since service area analyses are based on measurements along the network lines. 

This data type supports the following fields:

<StyledTable headers={"Field,Description"}>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`ObjectID` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The system-managed ID field.

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`FacilityID` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The unique identifier of the associated facility. 

If you specify `preserveObjectID=false` , the value for this field will be a system-generated ID. If `preserveObjectID=True` , the value for this field will be the ObjectID of your associated input.

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`SourceID` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Each service area line traverses a feature from a network source feature class—a feature class used to create the network dataset on which the service area analysis is performed. This field specifies the unique ID of the source feature class the traversed feature is a part of. 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`SourceOID` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The `ObjectID`  value of the traversed street feature. Summarizing the values for this field can provide useful information such as the number of times a particular street feature is included from the facilities. 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`FromPosition` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Specifies where along the underlying source feature the service area line begins. 

-   A value of 0 (zero) indicates that the service area line begins at the from point of the underlying source feature.
-   A value of 1 indicates that the service area line begins at the to point of the underlying source feature.
-   A value between 0 and 1 indicates that the line begins at a point along the underlying source feature; for example, a value of 0.25 means the line begins 25 percent along the digitized direction of the underlying source feature.

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`ToPosition` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Specifies where along the underlying source feature the service area line ends. 

-   A value of 0 (zero) indicates that the service area line ends at the from point of the underlying source feature.
-   A value of 1 indicates that the service area line ends at the to point of the underlying source feature.
-   A value between 0 and 1 indicates that the line ends at a point along the underlying source feature; for example, a value of 0.25 means the line ends 25 percent along the digitized direction of the underlying source feature.

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`FromCumul_[Cost]` 

(for instance, `FromCumul_Miles` , where `Miles`  is the travel cost)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

This field contains the cumulative cost of the path from the facility to the beginning of the line feature. The cost of the adjacent junction at the beginning of the line is included in this value. This field is generated for the cost attribute and any accumulation attributes.

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`ToCumul_[Cost]` 

(for instance, `ToCumul_Miles` , where `Miles`  is the travel cost)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

This field contains the cumulative cost of the path from the facility to the end of the line feature. The cost of the adjacent junction at the end of the line is excluded from this value. This field is generated for the cost attribute and any accumulation attributes.

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

</StyledTable>

### facilities

This provides access to the attributes of the facilities that are used in the service area analysis. You can use the attributes from this data type, such as the `Status`  field, to determine why a facility was not used in the analysis. 

The data type supports the following fields. In addition to these fields, the data type also includes all the fields from the input feature class used as facilities for the analysis.

<StyledTable headers={"Field,Description"}>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`ObjectID` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

If you specify `preserveObjectID=false` , the value for this field will be a system-generated ID. If `preserveObjectID=True` , the value for this field will be the ObjectID of your associated input.

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`Name`

The name of the facility. The values for this field are copied from the `Name`  field on the input facilities. 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`SourceID` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The numeric identifier of the network dataset source feature class on which the input point is located.

`Status` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Indicates how the facility was evaluated in the analysis. The possible values are the following:

-   0 (OK)—The facility was located on the transportation network and analyzed.
-   1 (Not Located)—The facility was not included in the analysis since a traversable road was not found within the maximum search distance from the facility.
-   3 (Elements not traversable)—The network element that the facility is on is not traversable. This can occur when the network element is restricted by a restriction attribute.
-   4 (Invalid Field Values)—Field values fall outside a range or coded-value domain. For example, a negative number may exist where positive numbers are required.
-   5 (Not Reached)—The facility couldn't be reached due to constraints; for example, a curb approach is set so that a vehicle must travel in the wrong direction on a one-way street to reach the facility.
-   7 (Not located on closest)—The closest network location to the facility is not traversable because of a restriction or barrier, so the facility has been located on the closest traversable network feature instead.

`Attr_[Cost]` 

(For instance, `Attr_TravelTime` , in which `TravelTime`  is the travel cost)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

This field stores the additional time, distance, or other travel cost for the facility. Adding a value to this field reduces the reach of the service area. 

If you're finding the service areas for three facilities using `TravelTime`  as the cost, the `Attr_TravelTime`  field can be used to store the amount of time spent at the facility.

For example, when calculating service areas that represent fire station response times, `Attr_TravelTime`  can store the turnout time, which is the time it takes a crew to put on the appropriate protective equipment and exit the fire station, for each fire station. Assume Fire Station 1 has a turnout time of one minute and Fire Station 2 has a turnout time of three minutes. If a five-minute service area is calculated for both fire stations, the actual service area for Fire Station 1 is four minutes (since one of the five minutes would be required as turnout time). Similarly, Fire Station 2 has a service area of only two minutes from the fire station.

The value you enter affects the analysis only when the \[Cost] part of the field name (`Attr_[Cost]`  matches the cost attribute chosen for the analysis layer or travel mode. For example, if you add a 5 to `Attr_TravelTime` , but the cost attribute used in the analysis is `Attr_TruckTravelTime` , the additional five minutes aren't included in the analysis results; however, if you change the network cost attribute to `TravelTime` , which corresponds with `Attr_TravelTime` , the five minutes you entered are added to the results.

`Breaks_[Impedance]` 

(For instance, `Breaks_TravelTime` , in which `TravelTime`  is the travel cost for the network)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

You can store different polygon break values for each service area facility in the `Breaks_[Cost]`  field. Given two facilities, this means you can generate 5- and 10-minute service area polygons for one facility and 6-, 9-, and 12-minute polygons for another facility.

The value specified in the `Breaks_[Impedance]`  field overrides the **Cutoffs** analysis layer setting. If no value for the `Breaks_[Impedance]`  field is specified, service area polygons are generated for the facility based on the **Cutoffs** setting.
