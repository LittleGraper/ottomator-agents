The previous service behavior was to always ignore such invalid locations which is still the default behavior. 
-   The job request of `Route`  and `ClosestFacility`  service returns two additional output parameters, [output_direction_points](/route-asynchronous-service#output_direction_points)  and [output_direction_lines](/route-asynchronous-service#output_direction_lines)  when the `populate_directions`  parameter is set to true. These new parameters provide additional information about travel directions such as point locations along the routes where specific directions events or maneuvers occur.

-    The `VehicleRoutingProblem`  service supports a new parameter, [ignore_invalid_order_locations](<TODO UNRESOLVED LINK: GUID-72B7F548-0777-441F-90BF-0A50B5A7AD34#GUID-72B7F548-0777-441F-90BF-0A50B5A7AD34/ESRI_SECTION3_73B67F42C8874ACDB9FC7C1355218A9D>) , that allows for finding routes even when one ore more orders are invalid, for example the order could not be located on the street network. The previous behavior of the service was to return a failure when at least one order was invalid. The default value (false) for `ignore_invalid_order_locations`  parameter still supports the existing behavior. 
-   Bugs were fixed.

## June 2020

-   `OriginDestinationCostMatrix`  service now supports a [direct request](/origin-destination-cost-matrix-synchronous-service) which should be used when solving small origin-destination cost matrices containing up to 10 origins and 10 destinations.

## December 2019

-   For all the services that support the job request, the following region names are no longer supported with the `analysis_region`  parameter and will be removed in future releases. If you specify one of the deprecated region names, the tool automatically assigns a supported region name for your region.

	-   `Greece`  redirects to `Europe` 
	-   `India`  redirects to `SouthAsia` 
	-   `Oceania`  redirects to `SouthAsia` 
	-   `SouthEastAsia`  redirects to `SouthAsia` 
	-   `Taiwan`  redirects to `SouthAsia` 

	The [data coverage page](/network-coverage) can be used to find out the region assigned to a country.
-   The job request for `ClosestFacility`  service allows you to specify a different number of facilities to find for each incident using the [TargetFacilityCount](/closest-facility-asynchronous-service#GUID-D294BD75-9749-42F3-A308-2A284023DF63)  attribute. Additionally, you can specify the cutoff value using the [Cutoff](/closest-facility-asynchronous-service#GUID-EA79D00C-20CD-459C-B39D-0901E2DA2C1D)  attribute, where the service will stop searching for the facilities from a given incident.
-   The use of `detailed_polygons`  parameter is deprecated in the job request for `ServiceArea`  service. Use the [polygon_detail](<TODO UNRESOLVED LINK: GUID-EFCEDD90-FB38-4CD4-9E2B-75F502716C3F#GUID-EFCEDD90-FB38-4CD4-9E2B-75F502716C3F/ESRI_SECTION3_27FAE43AC6C241559FB41E6CC004F5CC>)  parameter instead to generate the detailed polygons.
-    The job request for `ClosestFacility`  service returns [output_incidents](/closest-facility-asynchronous-service#output_incidents)  and [output_facilities](/closest-facility-asynchronous-service#output_closest_facilities-and-output_facilities)  output parameters.
-    The job request for `ServiceArea`  service returns [output_facilities](/service-area-asynchronous-service#output_facilities)  output parameter.
-   Bugs were fixed.

Both job and direct services impose limits when generating service area lines and other options related to generating polygons. Check the topics describing service limits for [direct](/service-area-synchronous-service#usage-limits) and [job](/service-area-asynchronous-service#usage-limits) request. 
-   Bugs were fixed.

## June 2019

-   Street data for most regions was updated to 2019 Q1 vintage. Check the [data coverage page](/network-coverage) for details about the street data vintage for your region. 
-   The `VehicleRoutingProblem`  service supports creating points for the output assigned stops and the output unassigned stops using the new [populate_stop_shapes](<TODO UNRESOLVED LINK: GUID-72B7F548-0777-441F-90BF-0A50B5A7AD34#GUID-72B7F548-0777-441F-90BF-0A50B5A7AD34/ESRI_SECTION3_015B7C2627AE4CD8B79E3AB149D9B85D>) parameter.
-   The `Route` , `ClosestFacility`  and `VehicleRoutingProblem`  services (direct request and job requests) support generating travel directions in additional languages. Refer to the documentation of the individual service to find out the list of supported directions languages. 
-   The `ServiceAreas`  service (direct and job requests) supports generating higher quality polygons that can include holes to indicate the areas that could not be reached. To generate detailed polygons set the [polygon_detail](<TODO UNRESOLVED LINK: GUID-EFCEDD90-FB38-4CD4-9E2B-75F502716C3F#GUID-EFCEDD90-FB38-4CD4-9E2B-75F502716C3F/ESRI_SECTION3_27FAE43AC6C241559FB41E6CC004F5CC>) parameter value to `High`  when using the job request. For direct request, set the `outputPolygons`  parameter to `esriNAOutputPolygonDetailed` 
-   The job request for`ServiceAreas`  service allows you to specify different break values per facility by specifying the `Breaks`  attribute of the input facilities. For example, given two facilities, this means you can generate 5- and 10-minute service area polygons for one facility and 6-, 9-, and 12-minute polygons for another facility. In previous versions, the same break values were applied to all the facilities. 
-   All the services that support job request support a new parameter, `output_format` , that allows you to obtain all the outputs as a single file. This is especially useful when the request can generate large result. For example, if you are working with the `GenerateOriginDestinationCostMatrix`  service and you generate a travel matrix with 1,000 origins and 1,000 destinations such that the result contains 1,000,000 records, returning such a large output as a Feature Set can cause the service to fail since the service will try to send the entire output in a single attempt. With a file based output, the service sends the output in multiple chunks reducing the possibility of timeouts when returning the outputs.
-   The `OriginDestinationCostMatrix`  service allows you to create the results as CSV files. Refer to the documentation for the [output_format](<TODO UNRESOLVED LINK: GUID-3ABE4D35-4CDB-4C03-9348-C794058D699B#GUID-3ABE4D35-4CDB-4C03-9348-C794058D699B/ESRI_SECTION3_721F8355C9DE4A0D8F2CCA437C34444E>) parameter for details.
-   All the services that support job request support `time_impedance`  and `distance_impedance`  parameters that allow to better model a custom travel mode for your analysis.
-   Bugs were fixed.
-   Performance, especially when running small jobs, was improved for all the services that support job request.

-   The job request for Route, ClosestFacility, and VehicleRoutingProblem services and the direct request for VehicleRoutingProblem service supports `save_route_data`  parameter that allows you to save the routes returned from the analysis as a zip file which can be subsequently used to create route layer items in your portal. 
-   The Route service with job request supports `time_zone_for_time_windows`  parameter that provides the ability to specify the time windows for the stops to be in UTC or in the time zone where the stops are geographically located. 
-   The direct as well as the job request for the VehicleRoutingProblem service supports `time_zone_usage_for_time_fields`  parameter that allows you to specify the time zone for all the input date-time fields supported by the service. 
-   The `stops`  parameter in the Route service with job request supports a `LocationType`  field that allows you to specify if the input stop is a location that the route should visit or it is a location that the route should travel through without making a stop (i.e treat the location as a waypoint). 
-   The `route_shape`  parameter of the Route and ClosestFacility services in job request support a `True Shape with Measures`  option that allows you to create output routes with measurements for linear referencing. The measurements increase from the first stop and record the cumulative travel time or travel distance in the units specified by the `measurement_units`  parameter.
-   The job request for the Route, ClosestFacility, ServiceAreas, LocationAllocation, VehicleRoutingProblem, and OriginDestinationCostMatrix and the direct request for the VehicleRoutingProblem services supports `save_output_network_analysis_layer`  parameter that allows you to save the analysis settings as a network analysis layer file. This file can be sent to Esri Technical Support in order to diagnose the quality of results returned from the service.
