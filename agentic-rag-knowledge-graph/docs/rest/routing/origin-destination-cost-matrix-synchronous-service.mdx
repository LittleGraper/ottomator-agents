Use the travel cost matrix service to create an origin-destination (OD) cost matrix from multiple origins to multiple destinations. A travel cost matrix is a table that contains the cost, such as the travel time or travel distance, from every origin to every destination. It also ranks the destinations that each origin connects to in ascending order based on the minimum cost required to travel from that origin to each destination. When generating a travel cost matrix, you can specify the maximum number of destinations to find for each origin and the maximum time or distance to travel when searching for destinations. 

The results from the travel cost matrix service often become input for other spatial analyses when the cost to travel on the street network is more appropriate than straight-line cost. For example, predicting the movement of people in a city is better modeled with costs based on street networks, since people tend to travel on roads and pedestrian paths.

The travel time, distance, or both for each origin-destination pair is stored in the output matrix (default) or as part of the attributes of the output lines, which can have no shapes or a straight-line shape. Even though the lines are straight, they always store the travel time and travel distance based on the street network, not based on Euclidean distance.

<Note type={"tip"}>

The closest facility and travel cost matrix services perform similar analyses; the main difference is in the output and the computation speed. The Travel cost matrix service generates results faster but cannot return lines that follow the underlying streets or driving directions. It is designed to quickly solve large M x N problems and, as a result, does not internally contain the information required to generate route shapes and driving directions. Alternatively, the Closest facility service can return routes that follow the underlying streets and directions but is slower to run than the Travel cost matrix service. If you need driving directions or true shapes of routes, use the Closest facility service; otherwise, use the Travel cost matrix service to reduce the computation time.

</Note>

<Note type={"note"}>

The service works in all the supported countries as listed in the [data coverage page](/network-coverage). One or more countries are grouped together to form an analysis region. The service can determine the best region to use based on the location of the inputs; otherwise, you can use a parameter to specify a region. The service does not support requests that span more than one region. Consequently, the service will only generate results for inputs that fall within one region. 

</Note>

## Request URL

The Travel cost matrix service supports [direct request](DEVSITE/documentation/glossary/direct-request/) and [job request](DEVSITE/documentation/glossary/job-request/). You can choose a request type based on the size of the problem you are trying to solve.

To learn more about the job request, see [Job request](/origin-destination-cost-matrix-service) documentation.

You can make a direct request to the Travel cost matrix service using the following form:

`https://route.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/OriginDestinationCostMatrix/NAServer/OriginDestinationCostMatrix_World/solveODCostMatrix?parameters`

## Required parameters

The following parameters are required.

### origins

Specifies the starting points from which to travel to the destinations. 

You can use a simple comma- and semicolon-based syntax if you are passing the input locations using their longitude and latitude values in the WGS84 coordinate system and don't need to pass additional fields for each location.

Simple syntax for origins

```other
origins=x1,y1; x2, y2; ...; xn, yn
```

 

Example using simple syntax

```other
origins=-117.1957,34.0564; -117.184,34.0546
```

 

The `origins`  parameter can be specified using a JSON structure that references a set of point features. The property is optional; however, the JSON structure must specify either the `url`  or `features`  property: 

-   `url` —Specify a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set. 

    The JSON structure can include the following property: 

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .
-   `features` —Specify an array of features. 

    Each feature in the `features`  array represents an origin and contains the following properties:

    -   `geometry` —Specify the input point geometry containing `x`  and `y`  properties along with the `spatialReference`  property. If the `spatialReference`  property is defined for the entire JSON, you don't need to define this property for each geometry. Doing so reduces the size of the input JSON if the input has many features and improves performance. This property is not required if the coordinates are in the default spatial reference, WGS84. If the coordinates are in a different spatial reference, you must specify the spatial reference's well-known ID (WKID). See [Using spatial references](DEVSITE/rest/services-reference/enterprise/using-spatial-references) to look up WKID values.

        <Note type={"tip"}>

        It is recommended that you explicitly specify the `spatialReference`  value, and specify it for the entire JSON rather than each individual geometry. 

        </Note>
    -   `attributes` —Specify each attribute as a key-value pair in which the key is the name of a given field, and the value is the attribute value for the corresponding field.

    The JSON structure can include the following property:

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .

#### Attributes for origins

When specifying the origins, you can set properties for each—such as its name or the number of destinations to find from the origin— using the following attributes:

-   `Name` 

    The name of the origin. The name can be a unique identifier for the origin. If `outputType`  is `esriNAODOutputStraightLines`  or `esriNAODOutputNoLines` , the name is included in the output lines `Name`  field (the output lines name will be origin name – destination name). The name is also included in the output origins as the `Name`  field.

    If the name is not specified, a unique name prefixed with Location is automatically generated.
-   `ObjectID` 

    The object ID of the origin. `ObjectID`  is a unique identifier for the origin. If the `outputType`  value is `esriNAODOutputStraightLines`  or `esriNAODOutputNoLines` , the `ObjectID`  value is included in the output lines (as the `OriginID`  field). If `outputType`  is `esriNAODOutputSparseMatrix` , the `ObjectID`  value is included in the output matrix. The `ObjectID`  value is also included in the output origins (as the `ObjectID`  field) and can be used to join additional information from tool outputs to the attribute of the origins. If the `ObjectID`  value is not specified, a unique ID is automatically generated in the output. 
-   `TargetDestinationCount` 

    The maximum number of destinations to find for the origin.

    If a value is not specified, the value from the `defaultTargetDestinationCount`  parameter is used.

    This field allows you to specify a different number of destinations to find for each origin. For example, using this field, you can find the three closest destinations from one origin and the two closest destinations from another origin. 
-   `Cutoff_[Impedance]` 

    If you want to stop searching for destinations once the search has exceeded a certain impedance value, specify a `Cutoff_[Impedance]`  field for your origin. 

    This is the impedance attribute name in the analysis, or the impedance name of the travel mode if you specify a travel mode. This attribute allows you to specify a different cutoff value for each destination. 

    For example, using this attribute, you can specify to search for destinations within five minutes of travel time from one origin and to search for destinations within eight minutes of travel time from another origin. 

    The units of the cutoff are the same as the units of the impedance attribute. If a value is not specified, the `defaultCutoff`  parameter value is used. 

    If you have multiple network cost attributes, you'll see multiple `Cutoff_[Impedance]`  fields. Consequently, you may have more than one time- or distance-based `Cutoff_[Impedance]`  field. The field values you provide are only referenced if the cost attribute referred to in the field name is used in the analysis as impedance attribute; it is not used if the attribute is used in the analysis as accumulate attribute.

    See the [list of cutoff impedance attributes](/origin-destination-cost-matrix-synchronous-service#UL_E9A3D790597F4A02B7A9DD23C6A4ABDE) supported by the service.
-   `CurbApproach` 

    Specifies the direction a vehicle may depart from the origin. 

    One of the integers listed in the Coded value column in the following table must be specified as a value of this attribute. The values in the Setting column are the descriptive names for `CurbApproach`  attribute values that you may have seen when using the ArcGIS Network Analyst extension software.

    The `CurbApproach`  attribute is designed to work with both types of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider an incident on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards is your decision to approach an incident from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at an incident and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the incident, choose 1 (Right side of vehicle) in the United States and 2 (Left side of vehicle) in the United Kingdom.

-   `Bearing` 

    The direction in which a point is moving. The units are degrees and are measured clockwise from true north. This field is used in conjunction with the `BearingTol`  field. 

    Bearing data is usually sent automatically from a mobile device equipped with a GPS receiver. Try to include bearing data if you are loading an input location that is moving, such as a pedestrian or a vehicle. 

    Using this field tends to prevent adding locations to the wrong edges, which can occur when a vehicle is near an intersection or an overpass, for example. Bearing also helps the tool determine on which side of the street the point is.

-   `BearingTol` 

    The bearing tolerance value creates a range of acceptable bearing values when locating moving points on an edge using the `Bearing`  field. If the `Bearing`  field value is within the range of acceptable values that are generated from the bearing tolerance on an edge, the point can be added as a network location there; otherwise, the closest point on the next-nearest edge is evaluated. 

    The units are in degrees, and the default value is 30. Values must be greater than 0 and less than 180. A value of 30 means that when Network Analyst attempts to add a network location on an edge, a range of acceptable bearing values is generated 15 degrees to either side of the edge (left and right) and in both digitized directions of the edge.

-   `NavLatency` 

    This field is only used in the solve process if the `Bearing`  and `BearingTol`  fields also have values; however, entering a `NavLatency`  field value is optional, even when values are present in `Bearing`  and `BearingTol` . `NavLatency`  indicates how much cost is expected to elapse from the moment GPS information is sent from a moving vehicle to a server and the moment the processed route is received by the vehicle's navigation device. 

    The units of `NavLatency`  are the same as the units of the impedance attribute.

#### Syntax for origins

The following is the syntax for specifying `origins`  using JSON structure for features:

```other
{
  "spatialReference": {
    "wkid": <wkid>,
    "latestWkid": <wkid>
  },
  "features": [
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": <x>,
        "y": <y>
      },
      "attributes": {
        "<field1>": <value11>,
        "<field2>": <value12>
      }
    },
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": <x>,
        "y": <y>
      },
      "attributes": {
        "<field1>": <value21>,
        "<field2>": <value22>
      }
    }
  ],
  "doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements": true | false
}


```

 

The following is the syntax for specifying `origins`  using a URL returning a JSON response:

```other
{
  "url": "<url>"
  "doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements": true | false
}


```

 

#### Examples for origins

Example one: Specifying `origins`  geometries in the Web Mercator spatial reference using JSON structure.

The example also shows how to specify the `origins` `Name`  attribute for each origin and specify a different number of destinations to find for each origin using the `TargetDestinationCount`  attribute. 

```other
{
  "spatialReference": {
    "wkid": 102100
  },
  "features": [
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -13635398.9398,
        "y": 4544699.034400001
      },
      "attributes": {
        "Name": "123 Main St",
        "TargetDestinationCount": 1
      }
    },
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -13632733.3441,
        "y": 4547651.028300002
      },
      "attributes": {
        "Name": "845 Mulberry St",
        "TargetDestinationCount": 2
      }
    }
  ]
}


```

 

Example two: Specifying `origins`  using a URL

The URL makes a query for a few features from a map service. A URL querying features from a feature service can also be specified.

```other
{
  "url": "https://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Network/USA/MapServer/1/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=Name,RouteName&f=json"
}


```

 

### destinations

Specifies the ending point locations to travel to from the origins.

You can use a simple comma- and semicolon-based syntax if you are passing the input locations using their longitude and latitude values in the WGS84 coordinate system and don't need to pass additional fields for each location.

Simple syntax for destinations

```other
destinations=x1,y1; x2, y2; ...; xn, yn
```

 

Example using simple syntax

```other
destinations=-117.1957,34.0564; -117.184,34.0546
```

 

The `destinations`  parameter can be specified using a JSON structure that references a set of point features. The property is optional; however, the JSON structure must specify either the `url`  or `features`  property: 

-   `url` —Specify a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set. 

    The JSON structure can include the following property: 

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .
-   `features` —Specify an array of features. 

    Each feature in the `features`  array represents a destination and contains the following properties:

    -   `geometry` —Specify the input point geometry containing `x`  and `y`  properties along with the `spatialReference`  property. If the `spatialReference`  property is defined for the entire JSON, you don't need to define this property for each geometry. Doing so reduces the size of the input JSON if the input has many features and improves performance. This property is not required if the coordinates are in the default spatial reference, WGS84. If the coordinates are in a different spatial reference, you must specify the spatial reference's well-known ID (WKID). See [Using spatial references](DEVSITE/rest/services-reference/enterprise/using-spatial-references) to look up WKID values.

        <Note type={"tip"}>

        It is recommended that you explicitly specify the `spatialReference`  value, and specify it for the entire JSON rather than each individual geometry. 

        </Note>
    -   `attributes` —Specify each attribute as a key-value pair in which the key is the name of a given field, and the value is the attribute value for the corresponding field.

    The JSON structure can include the following property:

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .

#### Attributes for destinations

When specifying the destinations, you can set properties for each—such as its name—using the following attributes:

-   `Name` 

    The name of the destination. The name can be a unique identifier for the destination. If `outputType`  is `esriNAODOutputStraightLines`  or `esriNAODOutputNoLines` , the name is included in the output lines `Name`  field (the output lines name will be origin name – destination name). The name is also included in the output destinations as the `Name`  field.

    If the name is not specified, a unique name prefixed with Location is automatically generated.
-   `ObjectID` 

    The object ID of the destination. `ObjectID`  is a unique identifier for the destination. If the `outputType`  value is `esriNAODOutputStraightLines`  or `esriNAODOutputNoLines` , the `ObjectID`  value is included in the output lines (as the `DestinationID`  field). If `outputType`  is `esriNAODOutputSparseMatrix` , the `ObjectID`  value is included in the output matrix. The `ObjectID`  value is also included in the output destinations (as the `ObjectID`  field) and can be used to join additional information from tool outputs to the attribute of the destinations. If the `ObjectID`  value is not specified, a unique ID is automatically generated in the output. 
-   `CurbApproach` 

    Specifies the direction a vehicle may arrive at the destination. 

    One of the integers listed in the Coded value column in the following table must be specified as a value of this attribute. The values in the Setting column are the descriptive names for `CurbApproach`  attribute values that you may have seen when using the ArcGIS Network Analyst extension software.

    The `CurbApproach`  attribute is designed to work with both types of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider an incident on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards is your decision to approach an incident from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at an incident and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the incident, choose 1 (Right side of vehicle) in the United States and 2 (Left side of vehicle) in the United Kingdom.

-   `Bearing` 

    The direction in which a point is moving. The units are degrees and are measured clockwise from true north. This field is used in conjunction with the `BearingTol`  field. 

    Bearing data is usually sent automatically from a mobile device equipped with a GPS receiver. Try to include bearing data if you are loading an input location that is moving, such as a pedestrian or a vehicle. 

    Using this field tends to prevent adding locations to the wrong edges, which can occur when a vehicle is near an intersection or an overpass, for example. Bearing also helps the tool determine on which side of the street the point is.

### token

Use this parameter to specify a token that provides the identity of a user that has the permissions to access the service. The [security and authentication](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/security/) page provides more information about how an access token can be obtained.

```other
token=<yourToken>
```

 

### f

Use this parameter to specify the response format. The parameter can have `json`  or `pjson`  as arguments, for example, `f=json` . The `pjson`  value is used for printing the JSON response in a prettified format. 

## Optional parameters

The following parameters are optional.

### travelMode

Choose the mode of transportation for the analysis. 

Travel modes are managed in ArcGIS Online and can be configured by the administrator of your organization to better reflect the organization's workflows. 

[Learn more about travel modes](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/travel-modes.htm)

The value for the `travelMode`  parameter is the JSON object containing the settings for a travel mode supported by your organization. To get the supported travel modes, run the `retrieveTravelModes`  service.

You can make a request to retrieve travel modes using the following form:

```javascript
https://route.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/OriginDestinationCostMatrix/NAServer/OriginDestinationCostMatrix_World/retrieveTravelModes?f=json&token=

```

 

<Note type={"note"}>

If you copy the URL above into a web browser, an invalid token error message will appear. You must replace `<yourToken>`  with a valid token. See [Security and authentication](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/security/) to learn how to generate one.

```

 

<Note type={"caution"}>

When the `travelMode`  parameter is set, you are choosing a travel mode configured in your organization, and the service automatically overrides the values of other parameters with values that model the chosen travel mode. The following parameters are overridden: `impedanceAttributeName` , `attributeParameterValues` , `restrictUturns` , `useHierarchy` , `restrictionAttributeNames` , and `directionsTimeAttributeName` . 

If you don't set the `travelMode`  parameter, the service honors the default or user-defined values for the parameters that would otherwise be overridden, so you can create your own travel mode.

Use this parameter to specify the travel time or travel distance value at which to stop searching for destinations from a given origin. 

The unit for this parameter is based on the unit of the impedance attribute specified using the `impedanceAttributeName`  parameter or the `impedanceAttributeName`  value of the travel mode if a travel mode is specified . If the `impedanceAttributeName`  parameter is `TravelTime` , the `defaultCutoff`  value is specified in minutes. Otherwise, the value is specified in miles or kilometers based on whether the `impedanceAttributeName`  parameter is set to `Miles`  or `Kilometers` , respectively.

The value for the `defaultCutoff`  parameter can be overridden on a per-origin basis by specifying a value for the `Cutoff_[Impedance]`  attribute when specifying the `origins`  parameter value.

### defaultTargetDestinationCount

The maximum number of destinations to find per origin. If a value for this parameter is not specified, the output matrix includes travel costs from each origin to every destination. 

The value for the `defaultTargetDestinationCount`  parameter can be overridden by specifying a value for the `TargetDestinationCount`  attribute when specifying the `origins`  parameter.

### outputType

Specify the type of route features that are output by the service. The `outputType`  parameter can have one of the following values:

-   `esriNAODOutputSparseMatrix` —Return the cost between origin and destination using a sparse matrix format.
-   `esriNAODOutputStraightLines` —Return a straight line between the origin and the destination.
-   `esriNAODOutputNoLines` —Do not return any shapes for the result.

### timeOfDay

The time and date to depart from the origins. You can also specify a value of `now`  to set the depart time from origins to the current time.

Specifying a time of day results in more accurate estimations of travel times because the travel times account for the traffic conditions that are applicable for that date and time. 

To use traffic in the analysis, set `impedanceAttributeName`  to `TravelTime` , and assign a `timeOfDay`  value. 

The `timeOfDay`  value represents the time at which the travel begins from the input origins. The time is specified as UNIX time (milliseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970). 

If a value of `now`  is passed to the `timeOfDay`  parameter, the travel begins at the current time. This will also override the `timeOfDayIsUTC`  parameter value to be `true` . When `timeOfDay`  is `now`  and `timeOfDayIsUTC`  is `true` , the travel will begin or end at input locations at the current time regardless of the time zone of the input locations. 

If a time of day is not passed in, the service uses static road speeds based on average historical speeds or posted speed limits. It uses posted speeds in areas where historical traffic information isn't available.

<Note type={"note"}>

Traffic is supported only with the driving time impedance or travel mode. It's not supported with trucking.

</Note>

The service support two kinds of traffic: live and typical.

If the `timeOfDay`  value specified is within 1 hour of the current time, live traffic will be used where available. Live traffic retrieves speeds based on phone probe records, sensors, and other data sources and reflects the current travel speeds and predicts speeds for the near future. If the `timeOfDay`  value specified is more than 1 hour earlier or later than the current time, or the road does not have live traffic, typical traffic speeds will be used. Typical speeds are based on historical traffic patterns. The travel time data is aggregated in 15-minute intervals per day of week based on multiple years worth of data. Consequently, a road may have a different travel time at Monday at 8:00 a.m., Monday at 8:15 a.m., or Tuesday at 8:00 a.m.. Since the variance is at the day of week and time of day, the travel time is the same on a road for any Monday at 8:00 a.m., regardless of the month or year.

If your goal is to model typical travel conditions and avoid large variances from the average due to live traffic, it is recommended that you use a date from the past to ensure that it doesn't coincide with the 1 hour window from the current time. As an extreme example, you can even use dates from 1990.

[ArcGIS Online Directions and Routing Services Coverage](http://links.esri.com/arcgis-online-data-coverage-map-for-directions-and-routes) shows the countries Esri currently provides traffic data for.

#### Typical traffic

To ensure the task uses typical traffic in locations where it is available, choose a time and day of the week; then convert the day of the week to one of the following dates from 1990:

-   Monday—1/1/1990
-   Tuesday—1/2/1990
-   Wednesday—1/3/1990
-   Thursday—1/4/1990
-   Friday—1/5/1990
-   Saturday—1/6/1990
-   Sunday—1/7/1990

Set the time and date as UNIX time in milliseconds. For example, to solve for 1:03 p.m. on Thursdays, set the time and date to 1:03 p.m., January 4, 1990, and convert to milliseconds (`631458180000` ). Although the dates representing days of the week are from 1990, typical traffic is calculated from recent traffic trends—usually over the last two years worth of data.

#### Live traffic

To use live traffic when and where it is available, choose a time and date and convert to UNIX time.

Esri saves live traffic data for 1 hour and references predictive data extending 1 hour into the future. If the time and date you specify for this parameter is outside the 2-hour time window, or the travel time in the analysis continues past the predictive data window, the task returns to typical traffic speeds.

#### Examples for timeOfDay

Example 1: 13:03, January 4, 1990. Typical traffic on Thursdays at 1:03 p.m.

```javascript
"timeOfDay": 631458180000
```

 

Example 2: 17:00, January 7, 1990. Typical traffic on Sundays at 5:00 p.m.

```javascript
"timeOfDay": 631731600000
```

 

Example 3: Specify the `now`  value. The analysis begins at the current time and live traffic speeds are referenced in the analysis.

```javascript
"timeOfDay": now
```

 

Example 4: 10:20, March 18, 2015. If the current time is between 6:20 a.m., March 18, 2015, and 2:20 p.m., March 18, 2015, live traffic speeds are referenced in the analysis; otherwise, typical traffic speeds are referenced.

```javascript
"timeOfDay": 1426674000000
```

 

### timeOfDayIsUTC

Specify the time zone or zones of the `timeOfDay`  parameter.

The default value is `false` 

#### False (use geographically local time zones)

The `timeOfDay`  value refers to the time zone or zones in which the input points are located. This option causes the analysis to have rolling start times across time zones.

The following image illustrates setting the value to `false`  (geographically local). Setting `timeOfDay`  to 9:00 a.m., January 4, 1990 (631443600000 milliseconds) and `timeOfDayIsUTC`  to `false` , and submitting a valid request causes the drive times for points in the eastern time zone to start at 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. central time for points in the central time zone. (The start times are offset by an hour in real or UTC time.) 

![timeOfDayIsUTC set to false](../../shared/routing/images/TimeZoneForTimeOfDay_GeoLocal.png)

_Input: `timeOfDay`  is 9:00 a.m., January 4, 1990 (631443600000 milliseconds), and `timeOfDayIsUTC`  is set to `false` _

#### True (use UTC)

The `timeOfDay`  value refers to coordinated universal time (UTC). The start times for all points are simultaneous, regardless of time zones.

The following image illustrates setting the value to `true`  (UTC). Setting `timeOfDay`  to 9:00 a.m., January 4, 1990 (631443600000 milliseconds) and `timeOfDayIsUTC`  to `true`  causes the start time for points in the eastern time zone to be 4:00 a.m. eastern time and 3:00 a.m. central time for those in the central time zone.

![timeOfDayIsUTC set to true](../../shared/routing/images/TimeZoneForTimeOfDay_utc.png)

_Input: `timeOfDay`  is 9:00 a.m., January 4, 1990 (631443600000 milliseconds), and `timeOfDayIsUTC`  is set to `true` _

### useHierarchy

Specify whether hierarchy will be used when finding the destinations.

<Note type={"note"}>

The value of this parameter, regardless of whether you use the default or explicitly set a value, is overridden when you pass in `travelMode` . 

</Note>

-   `true` —Use hierarchy when travelling from origins to destinations. When hierarchy is used, the service prefers higher-order streets (such as freeways) to lower-order streets (such as local roads), and can be used to simulate the driver preference of traveling on freeways instead of local roads even if that means a longer trip. This is especially true when finding routes to faraway locations, because drivers on long-distance trips tend to prefer traveling on freeways where stops, intersections, and turns can be avoided. Using hierarchy is computationally faster, especially for long-distance routes, since the service can determine the best route from a relatively smaller subset of streets.
-   `false` —Do not use hierarchy when travelling from origins to destinations. If hierarchy is not used, the service considers all the streets and doesn't prefer higher-order streets. This is often used when solving problems in a small area with a lot of destination but are specifying a cutoff based on a subset of them. 

<Note type={"note"}>

The service automatically reverts to using hierarchy if the straight-line distance between the stops is greater than 50 miles (80.46 kilometers), even if you have specified to find the route without using hierarchy.

</Note>

### restrictUTurns

Use this parameter to restrict or permit the route from making U-turns at junctions.

<Note type={"caution"}>

The value of this parameter, regardless of whether you use the default or explicitly set a value, is overridden when you pass in `travelMode` . 

</Note>

To understand the available parameter values, a junction is a point where only two streets intersect each other. If three or more streets intersect at a point, it is called as an intersection. A cul-de-sac is a dead-end. This parameter can have the following values:

<StyledTable headers={"Parameter value,Description"}>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`esriNFSBAllowBacktrack` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

U-turns are permitted everywhere. Permitting U-turns implies that the vehicle can turn around at a junction and double back on the same street. 

![U-turns permitted](../../shared/routing/images/U-TurnsAtJunctions_Allowed.png)

_U-turns are permitted at junctions with any number of adjacent streets._

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`esriNFSBAtDeadEndsAndIntersections` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

U-turns are prohibited at junctions where exactly two adjacent streets meet. 

![U-turns permitted only at intersections and dead-ends](../../shared/routing/images/U-TurnsAtJunctions_IntersectAndDeadEnds.png)

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`esriNFSBAtDeadEndsOnly` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

![U-turns permitted only at dead-ends](../../shared/routing/images/U-TurnsAtJunctions_DeadEnds.png)

_U-turns are permitted only at dead ends._

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`esriNFSBNoBacktrack` 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

U-turns are prohibited at all junctions, intersections, and dead-ends. Even when this parameter value is chosen, a route can still make U-turns at stops. To prohibit U-turns at a stop, you can set its `CurbApproach`  property to the appropriate value (3).

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

</StyledTable>

The default value is `esriNFSBAllowBacktrack` 

### impedanceAttributeName

Specify the impedance.

<Note type={"note"}>

The value of this parameter, regardless of whether you use the default or explicitly set a value, is overridden when you pass in `travelMode` . 

</Note>

Impedance is a value that quantifies travel along the transportation network. Travel distance is an example of impedance; it quantifies the length of walkways and road segments. Similarly, drive time—the typical time it takes to drive a car along a road segment—is an example of impedance. Drive times may vary by type of vehicle—for instance, the time it takes for a truck to travel along a path tends to be longer than a car—so there can be many impedance values representing travel times for different vehicle types. Impedance values may also vary with time; live and typical traffic reference dynamic impedance values. Each walkway and road segment stores at least one impedance value. When performing a network analysis, the impedance values are used to calculate the best results, such as finding the shortest route—the route that minimizes impedance—between two points.

The `impedanceAttributeName`  parameter can be specified using the following values:

-   **TravelTime**—Historical and live traffic data is used. This option is good for modeling the time it takes automobiles to travel along roads at a specific time of day using live traffic speed data where available. When using **TravelTime**, you can optionally set the TravelTime::Vehicle Maximum Speed (km/h) attribute parameter to specify the physical limitation of the speed the vehicle is capable of traveling.
-   **Minutes**—Live traffic data is not used, but historical average speeds for automobiles data is used.
-   **TruckTravelTime**—Historical and live traffic data is used, but the speed is capped at the posted truck speed limit. This is good for modeling the time it takes for the trucks to travel along roads at a specific time. When using **TruckTravelTime**, you can optionally set the TruckTravelTime::Vehicle Maximum Speed (km/h) attribute parameter to specify the physical limitation of the speed the truck is capable of traveling.
-   **TruckMinutes**—Live traffic data is not used, but the smaller of the historical average speeds for automobiles and the posted speed limits for trucks are used.
-   **WalkTime**—The default is a speed of 5 km/hr on all roads and paths, but this can be configured through the WalkTime::Walking Speed (km/h) attribute parameter.
-   **Miles**—Length measurements along roads are stored in miles and can be used for performing analysis based on shortest distance.
-   **Kilometers**—Length measurements along roads are stored in kilometers and can be used for performing analysis based on shortest distance.

### `accumulateAttributeNames` 

Use this parameter to specify whether the service will accumulate values other than the value specified for `impedanceAttributeName` . For example, if `impedanceAttributeName`  is set to `TravelTime` , the total travel time for the route will be calculated by the service. However, if you also want to calculate the total distance of the route in miles, you can specify `Miles`  as the value for the `accumulateAttributeNames`  parameter.

Specify the parameter value as a comma-separated list of names. The parameter values are the same as the `impedanceAttributeName`  parameter. For example, `accumulateAttributeNames=Miles,Kilometers`  indicates that the total cost of the route will also be calculated in miles and kilometers. 

<Note type={"note"}>

The values specified for the `accumulateAttributeNames`  parameter are for reference only. The service always uses `impedanceAttributeName`  to find the best routes.

</Note>

### restrictionAttributeNames

Use this parameter to specify the restrictions that will be honored by the service. A restriction represents a driving preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions cause roads or pathways to be prohibited, but they can also cause them to be avoided or preferred. For instance, using the `Avoid Toll  Roads`  restriction will result in a route that will include toll roads only when it is required to travel on toll roads to visit a stop. Use `Height Restriction`  to route around clearances that are lower than the height of the vehicle. If the vehicle is carrying corrosive materials, you can use the `Any Hazmat Prohibited`  restriction to prevent hauling the materials along roads where it is marked as illegal to do so.

<Note type={"note"}>

The value of this parameter, regardless of whether you use the default or explicitly set a value, is overridden when you pass in `travelMode` . 

</Note>

This parameter value is specified as a comma-separated list of restriction names. A value of none indicates that no restrictions will be used when finding the shortest paths. 

<Note type={"note"}>

Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries. If you specify restriction names that are not available in the country where the input points are located, the service ignores the invalid restrictions and returns warning messages indicating the names for the restrictions that were not considered when performing the analysis. 

</Note>

<Note type={"note"}>

You may need to specify an additional value, the restriction attribute parameter, for a restriction to get the intended results. This value must be associated with the restriction name and a restriction parameter using `attributeParameterValues` .

</Note>

The `restrictionAttributeNames`  parameter can be specified using the following values: 

-   Any Hazmat Prohibited—The results will not include roads where transporting any kind of hazardous material is prohibited. 
-   Avoid Carpool Roads—The results will avoid roads that are designated exclusively for car pool (high-occupancy) vehicles. 
-   Avoid Express Lanes—The results will avoid roads designated as express lanes. 
-   Avoid Ferries—The results will avoid ferries. 
-   Avoid Gates—The results will avoid roads where there are gates, such as keyed access or guard-controlled entryways.
-   Avoid Limited Access Roads—The results will avoid roads that are limited-access highways.
-   Avoid Private Roads—The results will avoid roads that are not publicly owned and maintained.
-   Avoid Roads Unsuitable for Pedestrians—The results will avoid roads that are unsuitable for pedestrians.
-   Avoid Stairways—The results will avoid all stairways on a pedestrian-suitable route.
-   Avoid Toll Roads—The results will avoid all toll roads for automobiles.
-   Avoid Toll Roads for Trucks—The results will avoid all toll roads for trucks.
-   Avoid Truck Restricted Roads—The results will avoid roads where trucks are not allowed, except when making deliveries.
-   Avoid Unpaved Roads—The results will avoid roads that are not paved (for example, dirt, gravel, and so on). 
-   Axle Count Restriction—The results will not include roads where trucks with the specified number of axles are prohibited. The number of axles can be specified using the Number of Axles restriction parameter.
-   Driving a Bus—The results will not include roads where buses are prohibited. Using this restriction will also ensure that the results will honor one-way streets. 
-   Driving a Taxi—The results will not include roads where taxis are prohibited. Using this restriction will also ensure that the results will honor one-way streets. 
-   Driving a Truck—The results will not include roads where trucks are prohibited. Using this restriction will also ensure that the results will honor one-way streets. 
-   Driving an Automobile—The results will not include roads where automobiles are prohibited. Using this restriction will also ensure that the results will honor one-way streets. 
-   Driving an Emergency Vehicle—The results will not include roads where emergency vehicles are prohibited. Using this restriction will also ensure that the results will honor one-way streets.
-   Height Restriction—The results will not include roads where the vehicle height exceeds the maximum allowed height for the road. The vehicle height can be specified using the Vehicle Height (meters) restriction parameter. 
-   Kingpin to Rear Axle Length Restriction—The results will not include roads where the vehicle length exceeds the maximum allowed kingpin to rear axle for all trucks on the road. The length between the vehicle kingpin and the rear axle can be specified using the Vehicle Kingpin to Rear Axle Length (meters) restriction parameter. 
-   Length Restriction—The results will not include roads where the vehicle length exceeds the maximum allowed length for the road. The vehicle length can be specified using the Vehicle Length (meters) restriction parameter. 
-   Preferred for Pedestrians—The results will use preferred routes suitable for pedestrian navigation. 
-   Riding a Motorcycle—The results will not include roads where motorcycles are prohibited. Using this restriction will also ensure that the results will honor one-way streets.
-   Roads Under Construction Prohibited—The results will not include roads that are under construction.
-   Semi or Tractor with One or More Trailers Prohibited—The results will not include roads where semis or tractors with one or more trailers are prohibited. 
-   Single Axle Vehicles Prohibited—The results will not include roads where vehicles with single axles are prohibited.
-   Tandem Axle Vehicles Prohibited—The results will not include roads where vehicles with tandem axles are prohibited.
-   Through Traffic Prohibited—The results will not include roads where through traffic (nonlocal traffic) is prohibited.
-   Truck with Trailers Restriction—The results will not include roads where trucks with the specified number of trailers on the truck are prohibited. The number of trailers on the truck can be specified using the Number of Trailers on Truck restriction parameter.
-   Use Preferred Hazmat Routes—The results will prefer roads that are designated for transporting hazardous materials. 
-   Use Preferred Truck Routes—The results will prefer roads that are designated as truck routes, such as roads that are part of the national network as specified by the National Surface Transportation Assistance Act in the United States, or roads that are designated as truck routes by the state or province, or roads that are preferred by truckers when driving in an area.
-   Walking—The results will not include roads where pedestrians are prohibited.
-   Weight Restriction—The results will not include roads where the vehicle weight exceeds the maximum allowed weight for the road. The vehicle weight can be specified using the Vehicle Weight (kilograms) restriction parameter.
-   Weight per Axle Restriction—The results will not include roads where the vehicle weight per axle exceeds the maximum allowed weight per axle for the road. The vehicle weight per axle can be specified using the Vehicle Weight per Axle (kilograms) restriction parameter.
-   Width Restriction—The results will not include roads where the vehicle width exceeds the maximum allowed width for the road. The vehicle width can be specified using the Vehicle Width (meters) restriction parameter.

The `Driving a Delivery Vehicle`  restriction attribute is no longer available. The service will ignore this restriction since it is invalid. To achieve similar results, use the `Driving a Truck`  restriction attribute along with the `Avoid Truck Restricted Roads`  restriction attribute.

The `restrictionAttributeName`  parameter value is specified as a list of restriction names. A value of `null`  indicates that no restrictions will be used when finding the best route, but only when `travelMode`  is set to `null` . 

### attributeParameterValues

Use this parameter to specify additional values required by an attribute or restriction, such as to specify whether the restriction prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on restricted roads. If the restriction is meant to avoid or prefer roads, you can further specify the degree to which they are avoided or preferred using this parameter. For example, you can choose to never use toll roads, avoid them as much as possible, or prefer them.

<Note type={"note"}>

The value of this parameter, regardless of whether you use the default or explicitly set a value, is overridden when you pass in `travelMode` . 

</Note>

This parameter value is specified as an array of objects each having the following properties:

-   `attributeName` —The name of the restriction.
-   `parameterName` —The name of the parameter associated with the restriction. A restriction can have one or more `parameterName`  properties.
-   `value` —The value for `parameterName` .

Most attribute parameters are related to the restriction attributes in `restrictionAttributeNames` . Each restriction has at least one attribute parameter named `Restriction Usage` , which specifies whether the restriction prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on the roads associated with the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or preferred. The `Restriction Usage`  parameter can be assigned any of the following string values or their equivalent numeric values in the parentheses:

-   `Prohibited`  (`-1` )—Travel on the roads that have the restriction is prohibited.
-   `Avoid_High`  (`5` )—It is very unlikely the service will include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.
-   `Avoid_Medium`  (`2` )—It is unlikely the service will include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.
-   `Avoid_Low`  (`1.3` )—It is somewhat unlikely the service will include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.
-   `Prefer_Low`  (`0.8` )—It is somewhat likely the service will include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.
-   `Prefer_Medium` (`0.5` )—It is likely the service will include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.
-   `Prefer_High`  (`0.2` )—It is very likely the service will include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.

<Note type={"note"}>

The `restrictionAttributeNames`  parameter is associated with `attributeParameterValues` . The restriction attribute's parameter value is specified as part of `attributeParameterValues` . Each restriction has at least one parameter named `Restriction Usage` , which specifies whether travel on roads that have the restriction is prohibited, should be avoided, or should be preferred. For the latter two options, it also specifies the degree to which the roads are avoided or preferred.

</Note>

The following table lists the attribute parameter names and the default parameter values.

<Note type={"tip"}>

To use the default value for a restriction, `attributeName` , `parameterName`  and `value`  do not need to be specified as part of the `attributeParameterValues`  parameter.

#### Syntax example for attributeParameterValues

```other
[
    {
        "attributeName": "<attribute1>",
        "parameterName": "<parameter1>",
        "value": "<value1>"
    },
    {
        "attributeName": "<attribute2>",
        "parameterName": "<parameter2>",
        "value": "<value2>"
    }
]
```

 

#### Example for attributeParameterValues

This example shows how to specify the height and weight of the vehicle for use with the height and weight restrictions, respectively, along with a high preference to include the designated truck routes. This results in a route that does not include roads where the clearance under overpasses or through tunnels is less than the vehicle height. The route will also not include roads with load-limited bridges or local roads that prohibit heavy vehicles if the vehicle weight exceeds the maximum permissible weight. However, the route will include as many roads as possible that are designated as preferred truck routes. 

The `Restriction Usage`  parameter for `Height Restriction`  and `Weight Restriction`  are not specified, as the default value of `Prohibit`  will be used for these restriction parameters. 

```other
attributeParameterValues=
[
    {
        "attributeName": "Height Restriction",
        "parameterName": "Vehicle Height (meters)",
        "value": 4.12
    },
    {
        "attributeName": "Weight Restriction",
        "parameterName": "Vehicle Weight (kilograms)",
        "value": 36287
    },
    {
        "attributeName": "Use Preferred Truck Routes",
        "parameterName": "Restriction Usage",
        "value": "Prefer_High"
    }
]
```

 

### barriers

Use this parameter to specify one or more points that will act as temporary restrictions or represent additional time or distance that may be required to travel on the underlying streets. For example, a point barrier can be used to represent a fallen tree along a street or a time delay spent at a railroad crossing.

<Note type={"note"}>

The service imposes a maximum limit of 250 point barriers. If this limit is exceeded, the response returns an error message.

</Note>

You can use a simple comma- and semicolon-based syntax if you are passing the point barrier locations using their longitude and latitude values in the WGS84 coordinate system and don't need to pass additional fields for each location.

Simple syntax for barriers

```other
barriers=x1,y1; x2, y2; ...; xn, yn
```

 

Example using simple syntax

```other
barriers=-117.1957,34.0564; -117.184,34.0546
```

 

You can specify barrier geometries as well as attributes using a more comprehensive JSON structure that references a set of features. The property is optional; however, the JSON structure must specify either the `url`  or `features`  property: 

-   `url` —Specify a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set. 

    The JSON structure can include the following property: 

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .
-   `features` —Specify an array of features. 

    Each feature in this array represents a point barrier and contains the following fields:

    -   `geometry` —Specify the input point geometry containing `x`  and `y`  properties along with the `spatialReference`  property. If the `spatialReference`  property is defined for the entire JSON, you don't need to define this property for each geometry. Doing so reduces the size of the input JSON if the input has many features and improves performance. This property is not required if the coordinates are in the default spatial reference, WGS84. If the coordinates are in a different spatial reference, you must specify the spatial reference's well-known ID (WKID). See [Using spatial references](DEVSITE/rest/services-reference/enterprise/using-spatial-references) to look up WKID values.

        <Note type={"tip"}>

        It is recommended that you explicitly specify the `spatialReference`  value, and specify it for the entire JSON rather than each individual geometry. 

        </Note>
    -   `attributes` —Specify each attribute as a key-value pair in which the key is the name of a given field, and the value is the attribute value for the corresponding field.

    The JSON structure can include the following property:

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .

#### Attribute for barriers

When specifying the `barriers`  parameter using JSON structure, you can specify additional information about barriers—such as the barrier type—using attributes. The `barriers`  parameter can be specified with the following attributes:

`Name` 

The name of the barrier.

`ObjectID` 

The object ID of the barrier. `ObjectID`  is a unique identifier for the barrier. If you want to maintain a relationship between the input and output, set `preserveObjectID`  to `true` . The `ObjectID`  value of the input barrier is included in the output barrier (as the `ObjectID`  field) and can be used to join additional information from analysis outputs to the attribute of the barriers. If the `ObjectID`  value is not specified, a unique ID is automatically generated in the output.

`BarrierType` 

Specifies whether the point barrier restricts travel completely or adds time or distance when it is crossed. The value for this attribute is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):

-   0 (Restriction)—Prohibits travel through the barrier. The barrier is referred to as a restriction point barrier since it acts as a restriction.

    ![Two maps demonstrate how a restriction point barrier affects a route analysis.](../../shared/routing/images/Point_Barriers.png)

    _The first map shows the shortest path between two stops without any restriction point barriers. The second map has a road that is blocked by a fallen tree, so the shortest path between the same points is longer._
-   2 (Added Cost)—Traveling through the barrier increases the travel time or distance by the amount specified in the `Attr_TravelTime` , `Attr_Miles` , `Attr_Kilometers` , `Attr_Minutes` , `Attr_WalkTime` , `Attr_TruckMinutes` , and `Attr_TruckTravelTime`  attributes. This barrier type is referred to as an added cost point barrier.

    ![Two maps demonstrate how added cost point barriers affect a route analysis.](../../shared/routing/images/nac_barriers_apoint.png)

    _The first map shows the shortest path between two stops without any added cost point barrier. For the second map, the travel time from stop 1 to stop 2 is the same whether going around the north end of the block or the south end; however, since crossing railroad tracks incurs a time penalty (modeled with added cost point barriers), the route with only one railroad crossing is chosen. The cost of crossing the barrier is added to the accumulated travel time of the resulting route._

<Note type={"note"}>

There is no point barrier type with a value of 1 for the `BarrierType`  attribute.

</Note>

`FullEdge` 

Specifies how the restriction point barriers are applied to the edge elements during the analysis. The field value is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses): 

-   0 (False)—Permits travel on the edge up to the barrier but not through it. This is the default value.
-   1 (True)—Restricts travel anywhere on the associated edge.

`Attr_[Cost]` 

Indicates how the cost (time or distance) is added when the barrier is traversed. This attribute is applicable only for added cost point barriers. The attribute value must be greater than or equal to zero.

`Attr_[Cost]`  is only referenced when the cost attribute referred to in the field name is used in the analysis as impedance or accumulate attribute.

See the [list of cost attributes](/origin-destination-cost-matrix-synchronous-service#impedanceattributename) supported by the service.

#### Examples for barriers

Example 1: Specify an added cost point barrier using JSON structure

This example shows how to use an added cost point barrier to model a five-minute delay at a railroad crossing. The `BarrierType`  attribute is used to specify that the point barrier is of type added cost and the `Attr_TravelTime`  attribute is used to specify the delay in minutes. 

```other
{
  "spatialReference": {
    "wkid": 4326
  },
  "features": [
    {
      "geometry": {
        "x": -122.053461,
        "y": 37.541479
      },
      "attributes": {
        "Name": "Haley St rail road crossing",
        "BarrierType": 2,
        "Attr_TravelTime": 5
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

 

Example 2: Specify a restriction point barrier using a URL

The URL makes a query for a few features from a map service. A URL querying features from a feature service can also be specified.

```javascript
{
    "url": "https://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Network/USA/MapServer/0/query?where=1%3D1&returnGeometry=true&f=json"
}
```

 

### polylineBarriers

Use this parameter to specify one or more lines that prohibit travel anywhere the lines intersect the streets. For example, a parade or protest that blocks traffic across several street segments can be modeled with a line barrier. A line barrier can also quickly fence off several roads from being traversed, thereby channeling possible routes away from undesirable parts of the street network.

![Two maps demonstrate how a line barrier affects finding a route between two stops.](../../shared/routing/images/Polyline_Barriers.png)

_The first map displays the shortest path between two stops. The second map shows the shortest path when several streets are blocked by a polyline barrier._

You can specify polyline barrier geometries as well as attributes using a JSON structure that references a set of features. The property is optional; however, the JSON structure must specify either the `url`  or `features`  property: 

-   `url` —Specify a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set. 

    The JSON structure can include the following property: 

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .
-   `features` —Specify an array of features. 

    Each feature in this array represents a polyline barrier and contains the following fields:

    -   `geometry` —Specify the input point geometry containing `x`  and `y`  properties along with the `spatialReference`  property. If the `spatialReference`  property is defined for the entire JSON, you don't need to define this property for each geometry. Doing so reduces the size of the input JSON if the input has many features and improves performance. This property is not required if the coordinates are in the default spatial reference, WGS84. If the coordinates are in a different spatial reference, you must specify the spatial reference's well-known ID (WKID). See [Using spatial references](DEVSITE/rest/services-reference/enterprise/using-spatial-references) to look up WKID values.

        <Note type={"tip"}>

        It is recommended that you explicitly specify the `spatialReference`  value, and specify it for the entire JSON rather than each individual geometry. 

        </Note>
    -   `attributes` —Specify each attribute as a key-value pair in which the key is the name of a given field, and the value is the attribute value for the corresponding field.

    The JSON structure can include the following property:

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .

#### Attributes for polylineBarriers

When specifying the `polylineBarriers`  parameter using JSON structure, the parameter can be specified with the following attribute:

`Name` 

The name of the barrier.

`ObjectID` 

The object ID of the line barrier. `ObjectID`  is a unique identifier for the line barrier. If you want to maintain a relationship between the input and output, set `preserveObjectID`  to `true` . The `ObjectID`  value of the input line barrier is included in the output line barrier (as the `ObjectID`  field) and can be used to join additional information from analysis outputs to the attribute of the line barriers. If the `ObjectID`  value is not specified, a unique ID is automatically generated in the output.

Example 1: Specify polyline barriers using JSON structure

This example shows how to add two lines as polyline barriers to restrict travel on the streets intersected by the lines. Barrier 1 is a single-part line feature composed of two points. Barrier 2 is a two-part line feature. The first part is composed of three points, and the second part is composed of two points.

Example 2: Specify a polyline barrier using a URL

The URL makes a query for a few features from a map service. A URL querying features from a feature service can also be specified.

```javascript
{

}
```

 

### polygonBarriers

Use this parameter to specify polygons that either completely restrict travel or proportionately scale the time or distance required to travel on the streets intersected by the polygons.

You can specify polygon barrier geometries as well as attributes using a JSON structure that references a set of features. The JSON structure can be specified as a `url`  or `features`  value.

-   `url` —Specify a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set. 

    The JSON structure can include the following property: 

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .
-   `features` —Specify an array of features. 

    Each feature in this array represents a polygon barrier and contains the following fields:

    -   `geometry` —Specify the input point geometry containing `x`  and `y`  properties along with the `spatialReference`  property. If the `spatialReference`  property is defined for the entire JSON, you don't need to define this property for each geometry. Doing so reduces the size of the input JSON if the input has many features and improves performance. This property is not required if the coordinates are in the default spatial reference, WGS84. If the coordinates are in a different spatial reference, you must specify the spatial reference's well-known ID (WKID). See [Using spatial references](DEVSITE/rest/services-reference/enterprise/using-spatial-references) to look up WKID values.

        <Note type={"tip"}>

        It is recommended that you explicitly specify the `spatialReference`  value, and specify it for the entire JSON rather than each individual geometry. 

        </Note>
    -   `attributes` —Specify each attribute as a key-value pair in which the key is the name of a given field, and the value is the attribute value for the corresponding field.

    The JSON structure can include the following property:

    -   `doNotLocateOnRestrictedElements`  (optional)—Specify whether the restricted network elements will be considered when finding network locations. The default is `true` .

#### Attributes for polygonBarriers

When specifying the `polygonBarriers`  parameter using JSON structure, you can specify additional information about barriers—such as the barrier type—using attributes. The `polygonBarriers`  parameter can be specified with the following attributes:

`Name` 

The name of the barrier.

`ObjectID` 

The object ID of the polygon barrier. `ObjectID`  is a unique identifier for the polygon barrier. If you want to maintain a relationship between the input and output, set `preserveObjectID`  to `true` . The `ObjectID`  value of the input polygon barrier is included in the output polygon barrier (as the `ObjectID`  field) and can be used to join additional information from analysis outputs to the attribute of the polygon barriers. If the `ObjectID`  value is not specified, a unique ID is automatically generated in the output.

`BarrierType` 

Use this parameter to specify polygons that either completely restrict travel or proportionately scale the time or distance required to travel on the streets intersected by the polygons.

-   0 (Restriction)—Prohibits traveling through any part of the barrier. The barrier is referred to as a restriction polygon barrier since it prohibits traveling on streets intersected by the barrier. One use of this type of barrier is to model floods covering areas of the street that make traveling on those streets impossible.

    This is the default value.

    ![Two maps demonstrate how a restriction polygon barrier affects finding a route between two stops.](../../shared/routing/images/Polygon_Barriers.png)

    _The first map depicts the shortest path between two stops. The second map shows a polygon barrier blocking flooded streets, so the shortest path between the same two stops is different._
-   1 (Scaled Cost)—Scales the time or distance required to travel the underlying streets by a factor specified using the `Attr_TravelTime` , `Attr_Miles` , `Attr_Kilometers` , `Attr_Minutes` , `Attr_WalkTime` , `Attr_TruckMinutes` , or `Attr_TruckTravelTime`  attributes. If the streets are partially covered by the barrier, the travel time or distance is apportioned and then scaled. For example, a factor of 0.25 means that travel on underlying streets is expected to be four times faster than normal. A factor of 3.0 means that it is expected to take three times longer than normal to travel on underlying streets. This barrier type is referred to as a scaled cost polygon barrier. It can be used to model storms that reduce travel speeds in specific regions, for example. 

    ![Two maps demonstrate how a scaled cost polygon barrier affects finding a route between two stops.](../../shared/routing/images/nac_barriers_spolygon.png)

    _The first map shows a route that goes through inclement weather without regard for the effect that poor road conditions have on travel time. The second map shows a scaled polygon barrier that doubles the travel time of the roads covered by the storm. The route still passes through the southern tip of the storm, since it is quicker to spend more time driving slowly through a small part of the storm rather than driving completely around it. The service uses the modified travel time in calculating the best route, and the modified travel time is reported as the total travel time in the response._

`Attr_[Cost]` 

This is the factor by which the cost of the streets intersected by the barrier is multiplied. This attribute is applicable only for scaled cost barriers. The attribute value must be greater than zero. 

`Attr_[Cost]`  is only referenced when it is used in the analysis as impedance or accumulate attribute.

#### Examples for polygonBarriers

Example 1: Specify a polygon barrier using JSON structure

This example shows how to add two polygons as barriers. The first polygon, Flood zone, is a restriction polygon barrier that prohibits travel on the underlying streets. The polygon is a single-part polygon feature composed of four points. The second polygon, Severe weather zone, is a scaled-cost polygon barrier that reduces the travel time on underlying streets to one-third of the original value. The polygon is a two-part polygon feature. Both parts are composed of four points.

  ]
}
```

 

Example 2: Specify a polygon barrier using a URL

The URL makes a query for a few features from a map service. A URL querying features from a feature service can also be specified.

```javascript
{
    "url": "https://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Network/USA/MapServer/7/query?where=1%3D1&returnGeometry=true&f=json"
}
```

 

### returnOrigins

Use this parameter to specify whether origins will be returned by the service. The possible values for this parameter are `true`  or `false` . A `true`  value indicates that the origins used as input will be returned as part of the `origins`  property in the JSON response. The default value for this parameter is `false` . 

### returnDestinations

Use this parameter to specify whether destinations will be returned by the service. The possible values for this parameter are `true`  or `false` . A `true`  value indicates that the destinations used as input will be returned as part of the `destinations`  property in the JSON response. The default value for this parameter is `false` . 

### returnBarriers

Specify whether barriers will be returned by the service.

-   `true` —The input point barriers are returned as part of the `barriers`  property in the JSON response.
-   `false` —Point barriers are not returned. This is the default.

For this parameter to take effect, you must also specify a value for the `barriers`  parameter.

If you specified the `barriers`  parameter value using a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set, you can set the `returnBarriers`  parameter to `true`  so you can draw the point barrier locations in the application. You can also set the `returnBarriers`  property to `true`  to see where the barriers were located on the street network or, if they weren't located, understand what the problem was by reviewing the `Status`  property in the JSON response.

### returnPolylineBarriers

Specify whether polyline barriers will be returned by the service. 

-   `true` —The input polyline barriers are returned as part of the `polylineBarriers`  property in the JSON response.
-   `false` —Polyline barriers are not returned. This is the default.

For this parameter to take effect, you must also specify a value for the `polylineBarriers`  parameter.

If you specified the `polylineBarriers`  parameter value using a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set, you can set the `returnPolylineBarriers`  parameter to `true`  so you can draw the polyline barrier locations in the application. 

### returnPolygonBarriers

Specify whether polygon barriers will be returned by the service. 

-   `true` —The input polygon barriers are returned as part of the `polygonBarriers`  property in the JSON response.
-   `false` —Polygon barriers are not returned. This is the default.

For this parameter to take effect, you must also specify a value for the `polygonBarriers`  parameter.

If you specified the `polygonBarriers`  parameter value using a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set, you can set the `returnPolygonBarriers`  parameter to `true`  so you can draw the polygon barrier locations in the application. 

### geometryPrecision

Use this parameter to specify the number of decimal places that will be used in the response geometries returned by the solve operation. This applies to x- and y-values only (not m- or z-values).

```javascript
geometryPrecision = 3
```

 

### ignoreInvalidLocations

Specifies whether invalid input locations will be ignored. 

-   `true` —

    Network locations that are unlocated will be ignored and the analysis will run using valid network locations only. The analysis will also continue if locations are on nontraversable elements or have other errors. This is useful if you know the network locations are not all correct, but you want to run the analysis with the network locations that are valid. This is the default.
-   `false` —

    Invalid locations will not be ignored. Do not run the analysis if there are invalid locations. Correct the invalid locations and rerun the analysis.

The default value is `true` .

### outSR

Use this parameter to specify the spatial reference of the geometries, such as line or point features, returned by the service.

The parameter value can be specified as a well-known ID (WKID) for the spatial reference. See [Using spatial references](DEVSITE/rest/services-reference/enterprise/using-spatial-references) to look up WKID values.

Many of the basemaps provided by ArcGIS Online are in the Web Mercator spatial reference (WKID 102100). Specifying `outSR=102100`  returns the geometries in the Web Mercator spatial reference, which can be drawn on top of the basemaps. 

### overrides

<Note type={"note"}>

This parameter is for internal use only.

</Note>

### returnEmptyResults

Specify whether the service will return empty results instead of the error property when the request fails.

-   `true` —The JSON response doesn't contain the error property when the request fails. All errors are returned in the messages property. The response JSON may contain an empty feature set or empty result for the properties you requested.
-   `false` —The JSON response only contains the error property when the request fails.

The default value is `false` .

Typically when a request fails, the service will return a JSON response that contains the error property. In some cases, you might want to set `returnEmptyResults`  to `true`  so it always returns properties you requested instead of returning an error response to help handle the response in a more consistent way. 

Even if the request fails, when you set `returnEmptyResults = true` , `returnOrigins = true` , and `returnDestinations = true` , you can return origins and destinations to investigate why some of them failed to locate.

### locateSettings

Use this parameter to specify settings that affect how inputs are located, such as the maximum search distance to use when locating the inputs on the network or the network sources being used for locating.

[Learn more about locating inputs](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/3.2/help/analysis/networks/locating-analysis-inputs)

The parameter value is specified as a JSON object. The JSON object allows you to specify a locator JSON for all input feature in the analysis, or you can specify an override for a particular input. The override allows you to have different settings for each analysis input. 					When specifying the `locateSettings`  JSON, you must provide all the properties including `tolerance` , `toleranceUnits` , `sources` , and `allowAutoRelocate`  in the default locator JSON object. If you need to provide a different locator JSON for a particular input class, you must include the overrides property for that input. The property name must match the input parameter name. The locator JSON for a particular input doesn't need to include all the properties; you only need to include the properties that are different from the default locator JSON properties.

The default value is as follows:

```javascript
{
  "default": {
    "tolerance": 20000,
    "toleranceUnits": "esriMeters",
    "allowAutoRelocate": true,
    "sources": [
      {
        "name": "main.Routing_Streets"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

 

The locator JSON object has following properties:

-   `tolerance`  and `toleranceUnits` —Allows you to control the maximum search distance when locating inputs. If no valid network location is found within this distance, the input features will be considered unlocated. A small search tolerance decreases the likelihood of locating on the wrong street but increases the likelihood of not finding any valid network location. The `toleranceUnits`  parameter value can be specified as one of the following values:

    -   `esriCentimeters` 
    -   `esriDecimalDegrees` 
    -   `esriDecimeters` 
    -   `esriFeet` 
    -   `esriInches` 
    -   `esriIntFeet` 
    -   `esriIntInches` 
    -   `esriIntMiles` 
    -   `esriIntNauticalMiles` 
    -   `esriIntYards` 
    -   `esriKilometers` 
    -   `esriMeters` 
    -   `esriMiles` 
    -   `esriMillimeters` 
    -   `esriNauticalMiles` 
    -   `esriYards` 
-   `sources` — Allows you to control which network source can be used for locating. For example, you can configure the analysis to locate inputs on streets but not on sidewalks. The list of possible sources on which to locate is specific to the network dataset this service references. Only the sources that are present in the sources array are used for locating. Sources is specified as an array of objects each having the following property:

    -   `name` —The name of the network source feature class that can be used for locating inputs
-   `allowAutoRelocate` —Allows you to control whether inputs with existing network location fields can be automatically relocated when solving to ensure valid, routable location fields for the analysis. If the value is `true` , points located on restricted network elements and points affected by barriers will be relocated to the closest routable location. If the value is `false` , network location fields will be used as is even if the points are unreachable, and this may cause the solve to fail. Even if the value is `false` , inputs with no location fields or incomplete location fields will be located during the solve operation.

<Note type={"note"}>

Currently, you can't specify different source names for the `sources`  array. Also, `allowAutoRelocate`  is always set to `true`  since the service does not support location fields. 

</Note>

#### Example for locateSettings

Example 1: Specify default locate settings using JSON structure

This example shows how to specify locate settings so inputs are located within 500 meters of the specified location. A small search tolerance like this can be valuable if you are solving using a walking travel mode and don't want inputs to be located farther than 500 meters from the original point location.

```javascript
{
  "default": {
    "tolerance": 500,
    "toleranceUnits": "esriMeters",
    "allowAutoRelocate": true,
    "sources": [
      {
        "name": "main.Routing_Streets"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

 

## Output parameters

The service returns the travel time or distance for each origin-destination pair. It returns either `odLines`  or `odCostMatrix`  for this information depending on the `outputType`  you specify. The service can also return the output origins, the output destinations, the output barriers, the output polygon barriers, and the output polyline barriers if you choose to return them. It also returns the status of whether the analysis was successful. This information is output in the following output parameters:

### odLines

When the `outputType`  is `esriNAODOutputNoLines`  or `esriNAODOutputStraightLines` , the output will be `odLines` . The `odLines`  output include geometry for the straight line connecting each origin-destination pairs when the `outputType`  is `esriNAODOutputStraightLines` . 

<StyledTable headers={"Field,Description"}>

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

</StyledTable>

### odCostMatrix

When the `outputType`  is `esriNAODOutputSparseMatrix` , the output is a JSON object that contains an array identified by `costAttributeNames`  to know what cost attributes are in the matrix and in what index. It then has an associative array of origins (identified by their ObjectID) each of which has an associative array of destinations (identified by their ObjectID) containing an array of costs that are in the same order as the `costAttributeNames`  array. 

In the example below, `TravelTime`  is the impedance attribute; and `Miles`  and `Kilometers`  are the accumulate attributes used in the analysis. In the returned matrix that contains the time and distance between origin-destination pair, each nested JSON is composed of origin ObjectID, destination ObjectID, and the costs from origin to destination in the order defined in the `costAttributeNames` . In the example below, travel from origin ObjectID 1 to destination ObjectID 1 takes 62.88 miles. 

```other
"odCostMatrix": {
  "costAttributeNames": [
   "TravelTime",
   "Miles",
   "Kilometers"
  ],
  "1": {

-   1 (Not Located)—The point was not located on the network and consequently was not included in the analysis.
-   2 (Network element not located)—The network element identified by the point's network location fields can't be found. This can occur when a network element where the point should be was deleted, and the network location was not recalculated.
-   3 (Element not traversable)—The network element that the point is located on is not traversable. This can occur when the element is restricted by a restriction attribute.
-   4 (Invalid Field Values)—Field values fall outside a range or coded-value domain. For example, a negative number exists where positive numbers are required.
-   5 (Not Reached)—The point can't be reached by the solver. The point may be on a separate, disconnected area of the network from the other inputs, or barriers or restrictions prevent travel to or from the point.

## Examples

<Note type={"caution"}>

If you copy and paste the request URL from the examples into a web browser, you need to replace `<yourToken>`  with a valid token. See [Security and authentication](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/security/) to learn more.

</Note>

### Calculate total travel time and distance between two cities 

This example shows how to calculate total travel time and distance between two cities (San Diego and Los Angeles), a typical travel cost matrix problem.

Specify the same two cities as the origins and destinations parameter to get travel time and distance traveling between these two cities. Use the JSON structure to specify the origins and destinations parameter, to specify the `Name`  and `ObjectID`  of the cities that will be included in the service output.

#### JSON response example

The default `outputType`  is `esriNAODOutputSparseMatrix` , so the response is a matrix format. The default `impedanceAttributeName`  is `TravelTime` , and the default `accumulateAttributeNames`  are `Miles`  and `Kilometers`  in the example below. The response contains the travel time, travel distance in miles, and travel distance in kilometers between San Diego and Los Angeles. Within the `odCostMatrix`  property, each nested JSON is composed of origin ObjectID, destination ObjectID, and the costs from origin to destination in the order defined in the `costAttributeNames` . 

```javascript
{
  "messages": [],
  "odCostMatrix": {
    "costAttributeNames": [
      "TravelTime",
      "Miles",
      "Kilometers"
    ]
    "1": {
      "1": [
        0,
        0,
        0
      ],
      "2": [
        157.0376430630198,
        124.20114191467465,

      ]
    },
    "2": {
      "1": [
        158.82792954092292,

      ],
      "2": [
        0,
        0,
        0
      ]
    },
    
  }
}


```

 

## JSON response syntax

The JSON response from the Travel cost matrix service is based on the following syntax when `outputType`  is `esriNAODOutputSparseMatrix` . The properties returned in the response are based on the request parameters. For example, the origins property is returned only if the `returnOrigins`  parameter is set to `true` . If a request fails, the JSON response only contains the error property. The examples in the subsequent section illustrate the response returned with specific request parameters.

### JSON response syntax for failed request

```javascript

```

 

When `outputType`  is `esriNAODOutputStraightLines`  or `esriNAODOutputNoLines` , the JSON response from the Travel cost matrix service includes the `odLines`  property. 

See [Error codes](/errorcodes-rest-api) for details about the extended code.

### JSON Response syntax for successful request when outputType is esriNAODOutputStraightLines

When the `outputType`  is `esriNAODOutputStraightLines` , the `odLines`  property includes geometry property for each feature. 

```javascript
{
  "odLines": {
    "spatialReference": {<spatialReference>},
    "features": [
      {
        "attributes": {
          "<field1>": <value11>,
          "<field2>": <value12>
        },
        "geometry": {<polyline1>}
      },
      {
        "attributes": {
          "<field1>": <value21>,
          "<field2>": <value22>
        },
        "geometry": {<polyline2>}
      }
    ]
  }
}


```

 

### JSON Response syntax for successful request when outputType is esriNAODOutputNoLines

When `outputType`  is `esriNAODOutputNoLines` , the `odLines`  property doesn't include geometry property for each feature.

```javascript
{
  "odLines": {
    "spatialReference": {<spatialReference>},
    "features": [
      {
        "attributes": {
          "<field1>": <value11>,
          "<field2>": <value12>
        }
      },
      {
        "attributes": {
          "<field1>": <value21>,
          "<field2>": <value22>
        }
