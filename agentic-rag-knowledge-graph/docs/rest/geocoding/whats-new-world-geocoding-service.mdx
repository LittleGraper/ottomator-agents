## December 2024

#### Quality improvements

-   Increased PointAddress match rates in Spain, Italy, Romania and Uruguay.
-   Improved Locality geocoding in Australia.
-   Addresses have been refactored in Colombia, leading to increased PointAddress and StreetName match rates.
-   Increased POI match rates in Germany, Indonesia, and Portugal.

#### API and service output changes

-   Two new output fields have been added to the responses for `findAddressCandidates`, `geocodeAddresses`, and `reverseGeocode` requests - [`StrucType`](/service-output#structype-serviceoutput-fields) and [`StrucDet`](/service-output#strucdet-serviceoutput-fields). The field values describe the primary usage for a structure or building. Currently the fields are only supported for PointAddress and Subaddress candidates in USA. Not all such records will include a value for these fields.
-   Maximum supported field lengths have been increased for some input address fields and output candidate fields. Information about field lengths can be found in the service info page: [ https://geocode.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/GeocodeServer?f=pjson](https://geocode.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/GeocodeServer?f=pjson).

## September 2024

#### Quality improvements

-   Increased PointAddress match rates in Brazil, Greece, India, and Thailand. 

#### API and service output changes

-   A new service endpoint—[batchGeocode](/batch-geocode) —which allows large files of addresses to be batch geocoded is now available. Refer to this [blog post](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/developers/announcements/discover-a-new-way-to-geocode-large-files/)  for a high level overview. 

## June 2024

#### Quality improvements

-   Increased PointAddress match rates in Colombia, Croatia, Malta, Portugal, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Suriname, Turkey, United Kingdom. 
-   Routing (street-side) locations are now available for most PointAddresses, which may improve the accuracy of navigation workflows that utilize geocoding to define destinations. Refer to the [locationType](/find-address-candidates#locationtype)  parameter description for more details.
-   POI geocoding is now supported for South Korea.
-   Subaddress geocoding is now supported for Belgium and Portugal. 

#### API and service output changes

-   When an invalid category value is included in a request, the request no longer results in an error. Instead, a responseInfo message is returned in the response which contains information about the invalid category values. Details can be found [here](/service-output#response-for-unsupported-category--value).

## March 2024

It allows you to search for a street between two intersecting cross streets, such as "Conway Dr between Sheridan Ave and E El Norte Pkwy". `Street Between`  is the category value that can be used with the [category](/category-filtering)  parameter to limit search results to StreetBetween candidates. 
-   The [outFields](/reverse-geocode#specify-output-fields)  parameter is now supported for `reverseGeocode`  requests. It allows you to specify a smaller set of output fields to be returned in the JSON response.
-   A new API parameter, [returnInputLocation](/reverse-geocode#use-input-coordinates-for-output-location) , is now supported for `reverseGeocode`  requests. It allows you to display the location of the input X/Y coordinates which were submitted in a `reverseGeocode`  request as a point on a map.
-   New output fields are returned for `reverseGeocode`  requests—[X](/service-output#GUID-BFD661FB-1180-45D8-9ECE-9868D95B7D6E) , [Y](/service-output#GUID-F9505F9C-5550-47B5-8776-3997F12B88F8) , [InputX](/service-output#GUID-6F4F71A9-831E-488F-9EF1-9CD2BCD59124) , and [InputY](/service-output#GUID-BFBF1ECA-8D63-42DB-BB80-45137C724329) .
