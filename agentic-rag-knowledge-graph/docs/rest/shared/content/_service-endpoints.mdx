<If c={!!props.intro}>
ArcGIS services hosted by Esri support <Term term="standard endpoint">standard endpoints</Term> and/or <Term term="enhanced endpoint">enhanced endpoints</Term>. The difference between them is the service URL, functionality available, security certification level, and geographic region it is hosted in. 

</If>

{/* ## Standard endpoints */}
<If c={!!props.standard}>
Standard endpoints are URLs for services hosted in a global cloud infrastructure, including the United States. The services are high-performance and optimized to use cloud resources closest to your geographic region. 

{/* When available, use standard endpoints for most development scenarios. */}

<If c={props.serviceName == "geocoding"}>
The standard endpoint for the ArcGIS Geocoding service is:
```
https://geocode-api.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/GeocodeServer
```
<Note type="tip">
Use the standard endpoint for most development scenarios unless you need additional functionality or a higher level of security compliance, then use enhanced endpoints.
</Note>
</If>
<If c={props.serviceName == "routing"}>
The ArcGIS Routing service does not provide a standard endpoint. Use the enhanced endpoint.
</If>
<If c={props.serviceName == "GeoEnrichment"}>
The ArcGIS GeoEnrichment service does not provide a standard endpoint. Use the enhanced endpoint.
</If>

</If>

{/* ## Enhanced endpoints */}
<If c={!!props.enhanced}>
Enhanced endpoints are URLs for services hosted in a cloud infrastructure in the United States. The services are also high performance, but provide additional functionality, and offer different regulatory compliance than standard endpoints. 

{/* When available, use these services to take advantage of the full capabilities of the service. */}

Some enhanced endpoints also support long transactions operations known as <Term term="job request">job requests</Term>. This provides the ability to easily execute and manage the processing of large amounts of data or computationally intensive operations.

<If c={props.serviceName == "geocoding"}>
The enhanced endpoint for the ArcGIS Geocoding serivce is:
```
https://geocode.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/GeocodeServer
```
<Note type="tip">
Use the enhanced endpoint when you want to access the full capabilities of ArcGIS services or to build applications with a higher security certification level. The performance will be best when accessed from the United States, but services can be accessed from any country around the world.
</Note>
</If>
<If c={props.serviceName == "routing"}>
The enhanced endpoints for the ArcGIS Routing serivce are:
```
https://route-api.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World
```
```
https://route.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World
```
```
https://logistics.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World
```

```
https://traffic.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World
```

<Note>
The `route-api` and `route` endpoints are functionally equivalent.
</Note>
</If>
<If c={props.serviceName == "GeoEnrichment"}>
The enhanced endpoint for the ArcGIS GeoEnrichment serivce is:
```
https://geoenrich.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/geoenrichmentserver/Geoenrichment/
```
</If>

</If>

{/* ## Regulatory compliance */}

<If c={!!props.regulartoryCompliance}>
Enhanced endpoints support different levels of regulatory compliance such as [Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)](https://www.cisa.gov/federal-information-security-modernization-act), [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)](https://www.fedramp.gov/), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html). 

Below is a summary of the regulatory compliance for services hosted by Esri.

{/* ## Choosing an endpoint */}
<If c={!!props.choosing && props.serviceName == "geocoding"}>
If both endpoints are available, for most application development scenarios, it is recommended to use <Term term="standard endpoint">standard endpoints</Term> first and then <Term term="enhanced endpoint">enhanced endpoints </Term> for any additional functionality required or if a higher level of security compliance is required.

Standard and enhanced endpoints have different base URLs, but the input parameters and output values are the same. Therefore, there is no difference how you use them to build applications.

To choose the best endpoint, consider the following:

1. The [functionality](#functionality-and-availability) required. Standard services are limited to the basemap styles service, geocoding service, and some routing service functionality.
2. The level of [regulatory compliance](#regulatory-compliance) required. For example, FedRAMP compliance.
3. The geographic region (global vs. United States) from which the services will be accessed.
