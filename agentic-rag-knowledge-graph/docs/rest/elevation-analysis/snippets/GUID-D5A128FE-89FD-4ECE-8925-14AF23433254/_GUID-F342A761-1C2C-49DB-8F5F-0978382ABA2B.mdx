In the ArcGIS API for Javascript, hydrology analysis is performed using the [Geoprocessor](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/geoprocessor-amd.html) class. The constructor to the Geoprocessor creates an instance pointing to the REST URL of the hydrology analysis service request you wish to perform. When the map is clicked, an event listener calls a function that adds a SimpleMarkerSymbol at the location of the click, assembles the parameters necessary to complete the request, and submits the job. Each hydrology analysis request has different input parameters, so be sure to read the documentation closely. A callback function is used to get and draw the result data once the job succeeds.
