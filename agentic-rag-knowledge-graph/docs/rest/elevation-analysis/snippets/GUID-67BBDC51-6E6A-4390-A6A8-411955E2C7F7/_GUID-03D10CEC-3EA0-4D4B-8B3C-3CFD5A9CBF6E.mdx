The output field `Length Meters`  holds the planimetric length of the profile line calculated as a geodesic distance and is the correct length regardless of the coordinate system of the data. This length will be different from the shape_length attribute due to the effects of map projection distortion. The output field `DEMResolution`  records the source DEM resolution used by the request. Three additional output fields are also available that identify the DEM data source used in the calculation. Those fields are `Product Name` , `Source` , and `Source URL` .
