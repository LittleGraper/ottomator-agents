## Description

The `OfflinePackaging` service creates and manages map areas. Map areas make it easier and faster for your users to work offline by packaging the map for a specific area ahead of time. Currently, map areas are only supported when using your own runtime app. For more information about the preplanned workflow, see [Mapping APIs and location services](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/offline/offline-maps/preplanned-vs-on-demand/#preplanned). You can create map areas using [ArcGIS API for Python](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/) or directly through REST calls.

## Key features

You can do the following using the `OfflinePackaging` service:

- Create a [map area](/create-map-area) from a web map.
- Define and create [packages](/setup-map-area) for each service in the web map within the map area extent.
- Refresh existing [map area packages](/refresh-map-area-package) to update them with changes.

## Access the service

To access the service, you need the following:

- An [ArcGIS Developer account](https://developers.arcgis.com/sign-up/) or [ArcGIS Online account](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/trial)
- An [access token](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/glossary/access-token/) (API key or OAuth 2.0)

<Note type={"tip"}>

To learn more about API keys and OAuth 2.0, see [Security and authentication](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/security/) in the [Mapping APIs and location services](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/) guide.
