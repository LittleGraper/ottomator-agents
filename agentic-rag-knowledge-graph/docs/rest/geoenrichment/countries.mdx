The GeoEnrichment service contains datasets which are specific to a single country or area. Each country has a unique, [two-character abbreviation](/geoenrichment-coverage#TABLE_E634EFE349BA4E1FA2689FB4B2910312) that acts as an ID that is passed in the `sourceCountry`  parameter of the GeoEnrichment service. The ID returned from the countries discovery method can be used to help query information about the country.
