## Example usage

The following is a sample ArcGIS Online POST request for the `canReassign` operation:

```markdown
POST /webadaptor/sharing/rest/content/users/itemowner/items/b512083cd1b64e2da1d3f66dbb135956/canReassign HTTP/1.1
Host: machine.domain.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: []

item=b512083cd1b64e2da1d3f66dbb135956&targetUsername=newOwner&f=pjson
``` 

The following is a sample ArcGIS Enterprise POST request for the `canReassign` operation:

```markdown
POST /webadaptor/sharing/rest/content/users/itemowner/items/b512083cd1b64e2da1d3f66dbb135956/canReassign HTTP/1.1
Host: machine.domain.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: []

item=b512083cd1b64e2da1d3f66dbb135956&targetUsername=newOwner&f=pjson
``` 

## Description

The `canReassign` operation checks whether an item owned by one user can be successfully [reassigned to a specified user](/reassign-item) before performing the [reassignItem](/reassign-item) operation. Users assigned the default administrator role, or a custom role with administrative privileges, can perform this operation. The item owner can also use this operation; if the item owner that performs this operation is not a default administrator, or assigned a custom role with administrative privileges, they must have the `portal:user:reassignItems` privilege assigned to them to transfer content to another user.

Some item relationships (for example, a view created from another view instead of a primary layer) may block item reassignment. The conflicting item is listed in the error response. 

<Note type={"note"}>

If any item that is being reassigned have a `private` sharing level, the receiving member must have sharing access to all groups which those items are currently shared to.

## Request parameters 

<StyledTable headers={"Parameter,Details"}>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      `[Common Parameters]` 

    </StyledTableCell>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      For a complete listing, see [Common parameters](/common-parameters).

  </StyledTableRow>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      `targetUsername` 

    </StyledTableCell>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      The username of the user the item will be reassigned to. For a user to be eligible to receive transferred content, they must meet the following requirements:

      -   The user must be assigned the `portal:user:receiveItems` privilege to receive the transferred content.
      -   The user must have a user type that allows them to own content. To learn more about user types, see the [User types, roles, and privileges](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/roles.htm) topic.
      -   If the item being transferred to the user is shared with a group, the user receiving the item must be a member of the group. If the group is a view-only group, the user receiving the item must be the group owner or a group manager.

      If the above requirements are not met, an error response will be returned.

      Example:

      ```markdown
      targetUsername=newOwner
      ``` 

    </StyledTableCell>
  </StyledTableRow>
</StyledTable>
