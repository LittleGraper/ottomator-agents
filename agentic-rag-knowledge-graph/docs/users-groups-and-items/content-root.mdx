## Description

The Portal Content Root operation consists of items, user and group content, and feature operations. It is a placeholder URI in that there is no response available at this URI. It acts as a root to its child resources and operations. All resources and operations (other than publicly accessible items) under this URI require an authenticated user (or a user token).
