## Example usage

The following is a sample ArcGIS Online request URL used to access an individual group's content resource:

```markdown
https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/groups/4774c1c2b79046f285b2e86e5a20319?f=pjson
```

The following is a sample ArcGIS Enterprise request URL used to access an individual group's content resource:

```markdown
https://machine.domain.com/webadaptor/sharing/rest/content/groups/4774c1c2b79046f285b2e86e5a20319?f=pjson
```

## Description

A group's content resource provides access to the group's shared items. Group items are stored by reference and are not physically stored in a group. Rather, they are stored as links to the original item in the [Item resource](/item). This resource is only available to the group owner and users.
