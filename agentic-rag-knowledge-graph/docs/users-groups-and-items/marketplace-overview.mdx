ArcGIS Marketplace allows ArcGIS organizations to purchase items (applications or data) that are offered for sale by other ArcGIS organizations. 

Only ArcGIS organizations that are pre-approved by Esri can offer items for sale. 

All ArcGIS organizations with valid subscriptions can purchase items.

To offer an item for sale, an approved seller creates a [listing](/listing) for the item using the [List Item](/list-item) operation. The listed item is kept private, but the listing is made public. 

A listing is a separate resource that has the same ID as its item but includes additional properties such as its license type (free or ELA) and information that indicates if customers can try the offering before buying. 

Prospective purchasers can find the listing by searching the marketplace using the [Listings Search](/listings-search) resource. 

The [Start Trial](/start-trial) operation on a listing allows a purchaser to start a trial for a listed item that offers trials. 

The [Express Interest](/express-interest) operation on a listing allows a prospective purchaser to express interest in a listing that is licensed and requires an agreement with the seller. 

Sellers can obtain the list of customers who have expressed interest, or have already purchased or are trying a listing using the [Customers](/customers-list) child resource of the sellers organization/portal.

The [Purchase Listing](/purchase-listing) operation on a listing allows a seller to complete a purchase (sale) for which a customer has expressed interest by provisioning the listing to the customer. This is done after the licensing terms have been agreed on out of band. The same operation can also be used by the purchaser to purchase and self provision free items. 

The result of provisioning an item is that the purchaser is able to use it (log in to the application or gain access to the data layer). This happens as a result of provisioning. The seller does not have to and should not explicitly share the listed item with the purchaser. It stays private from a sharing perspective.

Purchasers can obtain the list of purchases they have made by using the [Purchases](/purchases) child resource of the purchasers organization/portal.

The [Delete Provision](/delete-provision) operation allows a seller to delete a provision that was previously made. This prevents the purchaser from using the item.

Provisions can have end dates that are controlled by the seller; such provisions do not have to be explicitly deleted.
