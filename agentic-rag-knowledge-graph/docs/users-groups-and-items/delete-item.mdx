## Example Usage

URL for Delete Item

```markdown
https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/users/jsmith/items/b512083cd1b64e2da1d3f66dbb135956/delete
```

## Description

The Delete Item operation (POST only) removes both the item and its link from the user's folder by default. This operation is available to the user and to the administrator of the organization to which the user belongs. 

For ArcGIS Online organizations, the `delete` operation moves the item, if supported, to the recycle bin for 14 days before it is permanently deleted. Any [unsupported items](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/faq.htm#ESRI_QUESTIONANSWER_60A4B4E5F0994E8DB4A999818B19ED1D) are permanently deleted. Learn more about [permanently deleting](HTTPS://DOC.ARCGIS.COM/EN/ARCGIS-ONLINE/MANAGE-DATA/DELETE-ITEMS.HTM#ESRI_SECTION1_0B04A2F0D61D46E8AB6FA9CC4AEC68DC) and [restoring items](HTTPS://DOC.ARCGIS.COM/EN/ARCGIS-ONLINE/MANAGE-DATA/RESTORE-ITEMS.HTM).

<Note type={"note"}>

The `delete` operation has changed at ArcGIS Enterprise 10.6.1 so that when a service item that references a published service on a federated server is deleted, the corresponding service is also deleted from the server. If the item represents a capability for a service, like WMS, then the capability will be removed from its parent map service.
