## Example usage

Below is an ArcGIS Online sample request URL to retrieve the package info file for an uploaded item:

URL for package info file

```markdown
https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/af01df44bf36437fa8daed01407138ab/item.pkinfo
```

Below is an ArcGIS Enterprise sample request URL to retrieve the package info file for an uploaded item:

```markdown
https://machine.domain.com/webadaptor/sharing/rest/content/items/af01df44bf36437fa8daed01407138ab/item.pkinfo
``` 

## Description

Uploaded items will have a package info file available only if that item is an ArcGIS package (for example, a layer package or map package). It contains information that is used by clients (ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Explorer, and so on) to work appropriately with downloaded packages. Navigating to the URL will result in a package info file (`.pkinfo`) being downloaded. This is an XML file; there is no other file format available. There are no parameters associated with this endpoint.

## XML Response syntax

```markdown
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<pkinfo>
  <ID>package id</ID>
  <size>size of package </size>
  <created>date created shown in UNIX time</created>
  <type>type</type>
  <packagelocation>package location</packagelocation>
  <pkinfolocation>package info location</pkinfolocation>
</pkinfo>
```
