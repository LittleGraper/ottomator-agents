Listed below are new and updated resources and operations that have been added at each release.

## ArcGIS Online—November 2024

### New item types

- [Urban Project](/items-and-item-types/#applications)— This item type will store projects independently from the Urban model and allow to reference sub layers like the new Media Layers and 3D Object Feature Layers. Available only for ArcGIS Online deployments.
- [Pro Presentation](/items-and-item-types/#applications)— This is a new Pro item type, has been introduced at ArcGIS Pro 3.3, called a Presentation which is a view for creating pages using existing maps in the project, as well as blank pages for text, or pages for images or videos. The presentation can be displayed in full screen directly from the application. The presentation supports user defined properties for page appearance and playback experience. The presentation can be shared as a PDF, collection of images, a video, or a presentation file. The presentation file (.prsx) includes the presentation view, any added elements, and a reference to the underlying maps, layers or data sources. The data is not included. The ability to upload and share an .rptx file with ArcGIS Online provides an optimized user experience making it easier to share presentations between projects or with other users. Available only for ArcGIS Online deployments.

### New property

- [fontManifestUrl](/portal-self/#portal-self-response-properties)— A new self property that displays a URL with access to a manifest of all available fonts to the user.

### Search enhancements

- The user can now search for different types of imagery based on their image properties using `type`, `servicetags`, or `typeKeywords`. See [search reference](/search-reference/#search-for-imagery) for examples and more information.
- New [search](/search/#request-parameters) parameters `MeanPixelSize` and `BandCount` are added to support searching for imagery.

## ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4


### Item classification

Starting at ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4, organization administrators (those assigned either the default administrator role or that have been assigned a custom role that includes the **Organization website** privilege) can now assign a classification schema to their organization. By assigning a classification schema, organization members can classify items by adding appropriate classification and dissemination labels. For more information on item classification and classification schemas, see the [Item classification reference](/classification-reference) documentation.

A number of new endpoints have been added to the API to manage the organization's classification schema:

- [Classification](/classification)
- [Classification Schema](/classification-schema)
- [Assign Classification Schema](/assign-classification-schema)
- [Delete Classification Schema](/delete-classification-schema)
- [Validate Classification Schema](/validate-classification-schema)
- [Validate Classification](/validate-schema)

Once a classification schema has been assigned, new [items added to the organization](/add-item) will need to be classified. As well, preexisting items in the organization will need to be [updated to include classification markings](/update-item).

### Update public-facing URLs

At ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4, organization administrators that have been assigned the default administrator role can update the public-facing URLs for ArcGIS Enterprise portal and the organization's federated servers. Administrators may need to adjust the public-facing URLs for their organization for a number of reasons:

- To account for chaning their address from a **.com** address to a **.gov** address
- To set up a reverse proxy after configuring their organization and federating an ArcGIS Server
- To match the URLs to their organization's new branding

A number of new endpoints have been added to the API to check for affected organization items and update public-facing URLs:

* [Generate Organization URL Map](/generate-organization-url-map)
* [Generate URL Report](/generate-url-report)
* [Update Portal URL](/update-portal-url)
* [Update Update Federated Server URL](/update-federated-server-url)

### Changes to user type licensing

At ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4, the Partner user types (`liteUT`, `basicUT`, and `standardUT`) have been retired. Separate from these deprecations, the `GISProfessionalBasicUT` user type has been merged with the `creatorUT` user type. With this merge, users assigned the `creatorUT` user type will have access to the applications previously included with the `GISProfessionalBasicUT`.

The deprecated or removed user types cannot be used as the default user type for an organization, cannot be set as the user type assigned to new users, and cannot be assigned to the default administrator account when creating an organization. For more information about roles and user types, see User types, roles, and privileges for [ArcGIS Enterprise on Windows or Linux deployments](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/roles.htm) and [ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes deployments](https://enterprise-k8s.arcgis.com/en/latest/administer/roles.htm).

### Portal configuration file updates

Starting at ArcGIS Enterprise 11.0, the [update](/update-organization-settings) operation can be used to customize advanced portal options, such as configuring a disconnected deployment, using the `portalConfigProperties` parameter. Previously, administrators who needed to customize their portal's behavior would make updates to the editable version of the portal's configuration file (`config.js`). Though administrators no longer need to update the configuration file, it is recommended that they make a backup of it prior to upgrading to an 11.0 deployment to preserve the portal's previous customization and settings as a reference. After the upgrade, the properties defined in the configuration file will need to be manually applied to the `portalConfigProperties` parameter, as the Sharing API will not automatically harvest and apply the information in the file.

## ArcGIS Online—April 2021

### Table of contents

The sharing API table of contents has been reorganized to make it easier to find information. Topics are now organized by the structure of the URL of the resource or operation. 

For example, the previous section, [Content - Group Content](/group-content), has been updated to reflect the URL structure of that resource and its child endpoints as [/content/groups/\[groupID\]](/group-content). The topics have been sorted by their URL structure to better demonstrate the relationship between endpoints. For example, under the [.../\[username\]/items/\[itemID\]/proxies](/proxies) section, the topics Delete and Update have been renamed to [/\[proxyID\]/delete](/delete-proxy) and [/\[proxyID\]/update](/update-proxy) so that the relationship between the topics and its related endpoints can be easily determined.

In addition, endpoints that share the same name (for example, endpoint [/register](/register-app)) have been given additional contextual phrases to differentiate among them. For example, the topic for registering a server is called [/register (server)](/register-server) with the (server) context appended to differentiate it from other register endpoints, such as registering IDP [/register (idp)](/register-idp) and registering federation [/register (federation)](/register-federation).

Also, a new [conceptual hierarchy](/conceptual-hierarchy) page has been added to group endpoints together based on the conceptual relationship between endpoints.

### Topics

Topic information has also been improved. Each topic has had its title updated to reflect both the true endpoint name and its user-friendly alias. For example, the topic name for "[Check Service Name](/check-service-name)" has been updated to "/isServiceNameAvailable: Check Service Name". Also, the URL section, located at the top of each endpoint topic, has been updated to show the full path. Additionally, the example usage sections have been moved to the top of each topic next to the URL section.

### New item types

- [Earth Configuration](/items-and-item-types)—This item is used to create custom settings in ArcGIS Earth. It can be uploaded through the **Add Item** dialog box in **My Content** and shared in the organization with qualified accounts and user types. This item type is only applicable to ArcGIS Online organizations.

### New operations and resources

- [Reports](/reports)—The Reports operation generates the reports of the overall usage of the organizations. Reports define organization usage metrics in one place for the day, week, or month. Administrators can monitor who is using which services and how many credits and how much storage they are consuming within a specific time period. 

## ArcGIS Online—December 2020

### Version Management Privilege

The version management privilege (`features:user:manageVersions`) has been added to the selection of User privileges that can be [assigned to organization members through custom roles](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/roles.htm). Users assigned this privilege will have the ability to manage version locks as well as view, alter, delete, edit, reconcile, and post to all branch versions accessed through ArcGIS Server feature layers.

### Help Base

Administrators, with the appropriate privileges, will be able to update the help source option for your organization. The `helpBase` property can be updated to determine whether the help is derived from a locally installed source or via the web help (`https://enterprise.arcgis.com`) when internet access is available. By default, `helpBase` is set to use the local, installed source. For more information on this property and how to update it, see [Update portal](/update).

### Schedule Notebooks

Administrators and notebook authors with the **Schedule Notebook** privilege can now schedule ArcGIS Notebooks to run remotely at a scheduled time, either once or on a recurring basis through the Sharing API.

- [Import Group Content](/import-group) allows administrators to import items from an export package, which results from the Export operation, and adds all supported content items from the package to the selected group. When these items are added, their item IDs are maintained and associated URLs from the originating portal are swizzled to ensure they function in the new organization.
- [Describe Data Store](/describe-datastore) allows for initial and incremental discovery of a data store's content. The result of the operation is a list of content available from either the root folder of the data store or in folders that are available off of the root.
- [Publish Datasets](/publish-datasets-to-datastore) publishes services, by reference, from specified datasets in a data store. Currently, this operation only supports publishing scene services.

### Updated operations and resources

### Licensing updates

[User type extensions](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/license-user-type-extensions.htm) provide members of your organization access to Utility Network and Parcel Fabric functionalities. The GIS Professional Standard and GIS Professional Advanced user types include both the Utility Network and Parcel Fabric extensions. The Parcel Fabric extension can be included as an add-on for user types with at least the capability to view and edit data such as Editor, Field Worker, Creator and GIS Professional Basic user types. The Utility Network extension is compatible with all user types. You can view a user's user type, user type extensions, and add-on applications through the [User License Type](/user-license-types) and [Provisioned Listings](/provisioned-listings) resources.

### New member defaults

In June 2019 for ArcGIS Online, and starting at ArcGIS Enterprise 10.8, organizations now have the ability to set new member defaults for users who create their own built-in accounts, are added to the organization by an administrator, or are added through automatic account creation. Previously, new member defaults were set through the Portal Admin API or from the **Roles** tab in the **Organization Settings** of the portal. Now, new member defaults are configurable only from the [Set User Default Settings](/set-user-default-settings) operation or from the **New Member Defaults** tab in the **Organization Settings** of the portal.

### New operations and resources

This allows recipients to access the shared content without requiring credentials from the originating portal. Services shared before the credentials were set will be updated during the next synchronization to include this information.
- [User Default Settings](/user-default-settings) returns the organization's stored new member default settings.
