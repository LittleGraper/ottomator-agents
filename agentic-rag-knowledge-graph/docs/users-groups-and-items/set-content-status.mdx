## Example usage

The following is a sample ArcGIS Online POST request for the `setContentStatus` operation:

```other
POST /sharing/rest/content/items/c20206e7efd94c65a643cfa3c004734e/setContentStatus HTTP/1.1
Host: org.arcgis.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: []

status=org_authoritative&clearEmptyFields=false&f=pjson
``` 

The following is a sample ArcGIS Enterprise POST request for the `setContentStatus` operation:

```javascript
POST /webadaptor/sharing/rest/content/items/c20206e7efd94c65a643cfa3c004734e/setContentStatus HTTP/1.1
Host: machine.domain.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: []

status=org_authoritative&clearEmptyFields=false&f=pjson
``` 

## Description

The `setContentStatus` operation allows an item owner or organization administrator to change the status of an item to either authoritative or deprecated. To change an item's status, an item owner or organization administrator must be assigned a role that includes the `portal:admin:updateItems` [privilege](/privileges).

When an item is marked as authoritative (either `org_authoritative` or `public_authoritative`), it will be given an **Authoritative** badge, which indicates to organization members that the item is recommended for use. Items marked as authoritative are automatically protected to prevent accidental deletion and are boosted in search results to increase visibility and encourage use. When an item is marked as deprecated (`deprecated`), it will be given a **Deprecated** badge, which indicates to organization members that the item is not recommended for use.

Item status badges can be viewed in either an ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise portal site when in the **Content** tab, under either **My Content** for item owners or **My Organization** for all other organization members, as well as under the **Overview** tab when viewing the item's details. As well, the **Status** filter can be used to search the organization for authoritative or deprecated items.

Only organizations that have had their [identity verified](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/faq.htm#GUID-9958A59F-8950-4460-B866-01225AC7B3C2) by Esri can mark their items as `public_authoritative`. Once an organization has its identity verified, all items previously marked as `org_authoritative` will be automatically converted to `public_authoritative`. As well, if an item marked as `org_authoritative` is shared with the public from a verified organization, the item's status will automatically be converted to `public_authoritative`. Similarly, when unsharing an item from the public that is marked as `public_authoritative`, the item's status will be automatically changed to `org_authoritative`.

<Note type={"note"}>

Verified organizations cannot change their name; the organization must be unverified first. To change the name of a verified organization, all `public_authoritative` items must be unshared from the public or all instances of authoritative status must be removed from the organization before an organization can become unverified and change its name.

</Note>

An item's status can also be reset by clearing out the value for `status` (submitting an empty string) and selecting `clearEmptyFields` (`true`). Submitting a request with this information will immediately remove all badges and authoritative or deprecated status.
