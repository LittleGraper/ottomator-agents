## Description

The `inviteParticipant` operation allows you to invite other portals to your collaboration by creating an invitation file.

As a collaboration host, once you have set up a new collaboration, you are ready to invite other portals as participants in your collaboration. You need to send this invitation file to the administrator of the portal you are inviting to your collaboration. This can be done via email or through other communication channels that are established in your organization. It is important that the contents of this invitation file are not intercepted and tampered with by any unknown entity. The invitation file is in the format `collaboration-<guestHostDomain>.invite`.

The administrator of the participant will accept the invitation by importing the invitation file into their portal. Their acceptance is returned to you as another file that you must import into your portal using the [Import Invitation Response](/import-collaboration-invitation-response) operation. This will establish trust between your portal and that of your participant.

The response for this operation is a file download that contains the invitation for the participant.
