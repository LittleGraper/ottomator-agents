## Example usage

The following is a sample ArcGIS Enterprise POST request for the `canReassignItems` operation:

```markdown
POST /webadaptor/sharing/rest/content/users/itemOwner/canReassignItems HTTP/1.1
Host: machine.domain.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: []

items=0000737d2de44ea0a275a7fceba4da73&targetUsername=newOwner&f=pjson
```

## Description

The `canReassignItems` operation checks whether the items owned by one user can be successfully [reassigned to a specified user](/reassign-items) before performing the [Reassign Items](/reassign-items) operation. Users assigned the default administrator role, or a custom role with administrative privileges, can perform this operation. The item owner can also use this operation; if the item owner that performs this operation is not a default administrator, or assigned a custom role with administrative privileges, they must have the `portal:user:reassignItems` privilege assigned to them to transfer content to another user.

<Note type={"note"}>

If any of the items that are being reassigned have a `private` sharing level, the receiving member must have sharing access to all groups which those items are currently shared to.

</Note>

## Request parameters

<StyledTable headers={"Parameter,Details"}>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      `items` 

    </StyledTableCell>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      A comma-separated list of item IDs that will have their ownership transferred. The maximum number of items that can be transferred at one time is 100.

      Example:

      ```markdown
      items=0000737d2de44ea0a275a7fceba4da73
      ``` 

    </StyledTableCell>
  </StyledTableRow>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      `targetUsername` 

    </StyledTableCell>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      The username of the user the items will be reassigned to. For a user to be eligible to receive transferred content, they must meet the following requirements:

      -   The user must be assigned the `portal:user:receiveItems` privilege to receive the transferred content.
      -   The user must have a user type that allows them to own content. To learn more about user types, see the [User types, roles, and privileges](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/roles.htm) topic.
      -    If the items being transferred to the user are shared with a group, the user receiving the items must be a member of the group. If the group is a view-only group, the user receiving the items must be the group owner or a group manager.

      If the above requirements are not met, an error response will be returned.

      Example:

      ```markdown
      targetUsername=newOwner
      ```

    </StyledTableCell>
  </StyledTableRow>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      `f` 

    </StyledTableCell>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      The response format. The default format is `html`.

      Values: `html` \| `json` \| `pjson`

    </StyledTableCell>
  </StyledTableRow>
</StyledTable>

## JSON Response syntax

The response syntax example below demonstrates an error response, returned when the user specified in the `targetUsername` parameter does not have the proper permissions to be reassigned an item:

```other
{
  "error": {
    "code": <error code>,
    "messageCode": "<error message code>",
    "message": "<error message>",
    "details": [
      {
        "itemId": "<item id>",
        "type": "<item type>",
        "url": "<url>",
        "reservedTypeKeywords": [
          "<reserved type keyword1>"
        ],
        "owner": "<owner>"
      },
      {
        "itemId": "<item id>",
        "type": "<item type>",
        "url": "<url>",
        "reservedTypeKeywords": [
          "<reserved type keyword1>"
        ],
        "owner": "<owner>"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The response syntax example below demonstrates a success response:

```markdown
{
  "itemId": "<item id>",
  "success": true | false
}
```
