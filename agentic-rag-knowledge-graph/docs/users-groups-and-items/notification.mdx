## Description

An individual notification for the given user that can be of different types as described in the [Notification types](/notification) section below. Available only to the user recipient of the notification.

In the JSON response for a notification, the data property will vary based on the notification type. 


## Notification types

Notifications can be generated for many types of events—user applying to join a group, acceptance of a group application, rejection of a group application, and so on. Notifications are categorized by their `notificationType`. In the JSON response for a notification, the data property will vary based on the notification type. 

The supported notification types along with their data property examples are listed below. More types will be added as needed, and developers should ignore types they're unfamiliar with rather than throw an error.
