## Example usage

The following is a sample ArcGIS Enterprise POST request for the `reassignItems` operation:

```markdown
POST /webadaptor/sharing/rest/content/users/itemOwner/reassignItems HTTP/1.1
Host: machine.domain.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: []

items=0000737d2de44ea0a275a7fceba4da73&targetUsername=newOwner&targetFoldername=cityPlanning
```

## Description

The `reassignItems` operation [reassigns items](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/manage-items.htm#GUID-E901EEE3-9D45-449A-9608-3FE74BB58C9F) owned by one user to another user in the organization. Before performing this operation, it is recommended that you first [determine whether the user is eligible to receive content](/can-reassign-items). Users assigned the default administrator role, or a custom role with administrative privileges, can perform this operation. The item owner can also use this operation; if the item owner that performs this operation is not a default administrator, or assigned a custom role with administrative privileges, they must have the `portal:user:reassignItems` privilege assigned to them to transfer content to another user.

<Note type={"note"}>

If any of the items that are being reassigned have a `private` sharing level, the receiving member must have sharing access to all groups which those items are currently shared to.

</Note>

## Request parameters

<StyledTable headers={"Parameter,Details"}>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      `items` 

      (Required)

    </StyledTableCell>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      A comma-separated list of item IDs that will have their ownership transferred. The maximum number of items that can be transferred at one time is 100.

      Example:

      ```markdown
      items=0000737d2de44ea0a275a7fceba4da73
      ```

    </StyledTableCell>
  </StyledTableRow>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      `targetUsername` 

      (Required)

    </StyledTableCell>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      The username of the user the items will be reassigned to. For a user to be eligible to receive transferred content, they must meet the following requirements:

      -   The user must be assigned the `portal:user:receiveItems` privilege to receive the transferred content.
      -   The user must have a user type that allows them to own content. To learn more about user types, see the [User types, roles, and privileges](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/roles.htm) topic.
      -   If the items being transferred to the user are shared with a group, the user receiving the items must be a member of the group. If the group is a view-only group, the user receiving the items must be the group owner or a group manager.

      If the above requirements are not met, an error response will be returned.

      Example:

      ```markdown
      targetUsername=newOwner
      ``` 

    </StyledTableCell>
  </StyledTableRow>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      `targetFoldername` 

      (Optional)

    </StyledTableCell>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      The folder name the transferred items will be sent to. By default, if no folder is specified, the transferred items will be sent to a folder with the following format in which `[username]` represents the name of the original item owner, and `yyyy_mm_dd` represents the date the transfer occurred:

      ```other
      [username]_yyyy_mm_dd
      ``` 

      If the folder specified does not exist, it will be created when item ownership is transferred.

      Example:

      ```markdown
      targetFoldername=cityPlanning
      ``` 

    </StyledTableCell>
  </StyledTableRow>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      `f` 

    </StyledTableCell>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      The response format. The default format is `html`.

      Values: `html` \| `json` \| `pjson`

    </StyledTableCell>
  </StyledTableRow>
</StyledTable>
