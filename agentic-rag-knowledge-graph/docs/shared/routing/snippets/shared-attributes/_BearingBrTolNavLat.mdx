  The direction in which a point is moving. The units are degrees and are measured clockwise from true north.

  This attribute is used in conjunction with the `BearingTol` attribute. Bearing data is usually sent automatically from a mobile device equipped with a GPS receiver. Try to include bearing data if you are loading an input location that is moving, such as a pedestrian or a vehicle. Using this attribute tends to prevent adding locations to the wrong edges, which can occur when a vehicle is near an intersection or an overpass, for example. Bearing also helps the solver determine the side of the street that the point is on.

  The bearing tolerance value creates a range of acceptable bearing values when locating moving points on an edge using the `Bearing` attribute.

  If the `Bearing` attribute value is within the range of acceptable values that are generated from the bearing tolerance on an edge, the point can be added as a network location there; otherwise, the closest point on the next-nearest edge is evaluated. The units are in degrees. A value of 30 means that when Network Analyst attempts to add a network location on an edge, a range of acceptable bearing values is generated 15 degrees to either side of the edge (left and right) and in both digitized directions of the edge.

  Indicates how much cost is expected to elapse from the moment GPS information is sent from a moving vehicle to a server and the moment the processed route is received by the vehicle's navigation device.

  This attribute is only used in the solve process if the `Bearing` and `BearingTol` fields also have values; however, providing a `NavLatency` attribute value is optional, even when values are present in the `Bearing` and `BearingTol`.
