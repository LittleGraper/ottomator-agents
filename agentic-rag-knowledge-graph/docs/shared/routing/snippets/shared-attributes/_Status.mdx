  Allowed values: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`

  Indicates the status of the point with respect to its location on the network and the outcome of the analysis. The possible values are as following:

   - `0`: OK.The point was located on the network.
   - `1`: Not Located. The point was not located on the network and was not included in the analysis.
   - `2`:  Network element not located. The network element identified by the point's network location fields cannot be found. This can occur when a network element where the point should be was deleted, and the network location was not recalculated.
   - `3`: Element not traversable. The network element that the point is located on is not traversable. This can occur when the element is restricted by a restriction attribute.
   - `4`: Invalid Field Values. Field values fall outside a range or coded-value domain. For example, a negative number exists where positive numbers are required.
   - `5`: Not reached. The point cannot be reached by the solver. The point may be on a separate, disconnected area of the network from the other inputs, or barriers or restrictions prevent travel to or from the point.
   - `6`: Time window violation. The point could not be reached within the designated time windows. This status only applies to network analysis types that support time windows.
   - `7`: Not located on closest. The closest network location to the point is not traversable because of a restriction or barrier, so the point has been located on the closest traversable network feature instead. If time windows are used and the route arrives early or late, the value changes to 6 (Time window violation)
