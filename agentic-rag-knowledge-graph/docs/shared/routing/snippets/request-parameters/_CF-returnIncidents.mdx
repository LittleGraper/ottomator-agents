Specify whether incidents will be returned by the service.  

-   `true`—The incidents used as input will be returned as part of the `incidents` property in the JSON response.
-   `false`—The incidents are not returned. 

If you specified the `incidents` parameter value using a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set, you can set the `returnIncidents` parameter to `true` so you can draw the incident locations in the application. You can also set the `returnIncidents` property to `true` to determine whether the incidents were successfully located on the street network or had other errors by reviewing the `Status` property in the JSON response.
