Specify one or more depots for the given vehicle routing problem. A depot is a location that a vehicle departs from at the beginning of its workday and returns to at the end of the workday. Vehicles are loaded (for deliveries) or unloaded (for pickups) at depots. In some cases, a depot can also act as a renewal location whereby the vehicle can unload or reload and continue performing deliveries and pickups. A depot has open and close times, as specified by a hard time window. Vehicles can't arrive at a depot outside of this time window.

When specifying the depots, you can set attributes for each as follows:

#### Attributes for depots

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ObjectID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span></p>

    The system-managed ID field.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Name</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 500)</span></p>

    The name of the depot. The `StartDepotName` and `EndDepotName` fields on routes reference the names you specify here. It is also referenced by the route renewals, when used. 

    Depot names are not case sensitive but must be nonempty and unique.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Description</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 500)</span></p>

    The descriptive information about the depot location. This can contain any textual information and has no restrictions for uniqueness. 
    For example, if you want to note which region a depot is in or the depot's address and telephone number, you can enter the information here rather than in the `Name` field.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">TimeWindowStart1</span><a class="font-sm text-color-3" href="../routing-data-types#datetime">datetime</a><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The beginning time of the first time window for the network location. This field can contain a null value; a null value indicates no beginning time.

    The time window fields (`TimeWindowStart1`, `TimeWindowEnd1`, `TimeWindowStart2`, and `TimeWindowEnd2`) must be specified in a date field as an integer that represents the number of milliseconds since epoch (January 1, 1970) and not as date-time values. The time zone for time window fields is specified using the [`time_zone_usage_for_time_fields`](#time_zone_usage_for_time_fields) parameter. For example, if the orders are located in the Pacific standard time zone and you want to specify that the time window should start at 8:00 a.m. (local time) on November 18, 2019, the value for the `TimeWindowStart1` field should be specified as milliseconds since epoch for this date and time, which is 1574064000000. You also should specify the `time_zone_usage_for_time_fields`  parameter value as `GEO_LOCAL`.

    When solving a problem that spans multiple time zones, each depot's time-window values refer to the time zone in which the depot is located.

    Allowed values: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`

    Specify the direction a vehicle may arrive at and depart from the depot. The options are as following:

    - `0`: Either side of vehicle. The vehicle can approach and depart the depot in either direction. U-turns are allowed. You should choose this setting if your vehicle can make a U-turn at the depot or if it can pull into a driveway or parking lot and turn around.
    - `1`: Right side of vehicle. When the vehicle approaches and departs the depot, the curb must be on the right side of the vehicle. A U-turn is prohibited.
    - `2`: Left side of vehicle. When the vehicle approaches and departs the depot, the curb must be on the left side of the vehicle. A U-turn is prohibited.
    - `3`: No U-turn. When the vehicle approaches the depot, the curb can be on either side of the vehicle; however, the vehicle must depart without turning around. [Learn more about U-turn policies](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/networks/u-turn-policies.htm)

        The vehicle can approach and depart the depot in either direction, so a U-turn is allowed at the depot. This setting can be chosen if it is possible and desirable for your vehicle to turn around at the depot. This decision may depend on the width of the road and the amount of traffic or whether the depot has a parking lot where vehicles can pull in and turn around.

        The `CurbApproach`  attribute is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a depot on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards is your decision to approach a depot from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at a depot and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the depot, choose 1 (Right side of vehicle) in the United States and 2 (Left side of vehicle) in the United Kingdom.
