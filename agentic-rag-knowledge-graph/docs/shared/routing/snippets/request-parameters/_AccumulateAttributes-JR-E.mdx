A list of cost attributes to be accumulated during analysis. These accumulated attributes are for reference only; the solver only uses the cost attribute used by the designated travel mode when solving the analysis.

For each cost attribute that is accumulated, a `Total_[Cost Attribute Name]_[Units]` field is populated in the outputs created from the service.
