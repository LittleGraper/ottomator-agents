Specify whether invalid input locations will be ignored. 

-   `true`—Network locations that are unlocated will be ignored and the analysis will run using valid network locations only. The analysis will also continue if locations are on non-traversable elements or have other errors. This is useful if you know the network locations are not all correct, but you want to run the analysis with the network locations that are valid. 
-   `false`—Invalid locations will not be ignored. Do not run the analysis if there are invalid locations. Correct the invalid locations and rerun the analysis.
