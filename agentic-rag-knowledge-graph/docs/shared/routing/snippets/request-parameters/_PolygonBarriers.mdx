Specify polygons that either completely restrict travel or proportionately scale the time or distance required to travel on the streets intersected by the polygons.

When specifying polygon barriers, you can set properties for each, such as its name or barrier type, using the following attributes:

- <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Name</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

  The name of the barrier.

  The object ID of the polygon barrier. `ObjectID` is a unique identifier for the polygon barrier. If you want to maintain a relationship between the input and output, set `preserveObjectID` to `true`. The `ObjectID` value of the input polygon barrier is included in the output polygon barrier (as the `ObjectID` field) and can be used to join additional information from analysis outputs to the attribute of the polygon barriers. If the `ObjectID` value is not specified, a unique ID is automatically generated in the output.

  You can specify a network location using `SourceID`, `SourceOID`, `PosAlong`, and `SideOfEdge` described below. If the network location is not provided, the solver will derive it from the input geometry

  The position along the digitized direction of the source line feature. This value is stored as a ratio. This attribute is null if the network location references a junction.

- <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">SideOfEdge</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">int enum</span></p>

   The side of the edge in relation to the digitized direction of the line feature.

  This attribute is specific to scaled-cost barriers. It is the factor by which the cost of edges underlying the barrier are multiplied.

  Allowed values: `0`, `1`

  Specify polygons that either completely restrict travel or proportionately scale the time or distance required to travel on the streets intersected by the polygons.

  The value for this attribute can be specified as one of the following integers:

  - `0`: Restriction. Prohibits traveling through any part of the barrier. The barrier is referred to as a restriction polygon barrier since it prohibits traveling on streets intersected by the barrier. One use of this type of barrier is to model floods covering areas of the street that make traveling on those streets impossible.

    ![Two maps demonstrate how a restriction polygon barrier affects finding a route between two stops.](../../images/Polygon_Barriers.png)

    _The first map depicts the shortest path between two stops. The second map shows a polygon barrier blocking flooded streets, so the shortest path between the same two stops is different._

  <If c="requestType == 'job'">
  - `1`: Scaled Cost. Scales the cost (such as travel time or distance) required to travel the underlying streets by a factor specified using the `ScaledTimeFactor` or `ScaledDistanceFactor` attribute. 
  
    If the streets are partially covered by the barrier, the travel time or distance is apportioned and then scaled. For example, a factor of 0.25 means that travel on underlying streets is expected to be four times faster than normal. A factor of 3.0 means it is expected to take three times longer than normal to travel on underlying streets. This barrier type is referred to as a scaled-cost polygon barrier. It can be used to model storms that reduce travel speeds in specific regions, for example.
  </If>

  <If c="requestType == 'direct'">
  - `1`: Scaled Cost. Scales the cost (such as travel time or distance) required to travel the underlying streets by a factor specified using the `Attr_[Cost]` attributes.

    ![Two maps demonstrate how a scaled cost polygon barrier affects finding a route between two stops.](../../images/nac_barriers_spolygon.png)

    _The first map shows a route that goes through inclement weather without regard for the effect that poor road conditions have on travel time. The second map shows a scaled polygon barrier that doubles the travel time of the roads covered by the storm. The route still passes through the southern tip of the storm since it is quicker to spend more time driving slowly through a small part of the storm rather than driving completely around it. The service uses the modified travel time in calculating the best route, and the modified travel time is reported as the total travel time in the response._

This example shows how to add two polygons as barriers. The first polygon, Flood zone, is a restriction polygon barrier that prohibits travel on the underlying streets. The polygon is a single-part polygon feature composed of four points. The second polygon, Severe weather zone, is a scaled-cost polygon barrier that reduces the travel time on underlying streets to one-third of the original value. The polygon is a two-part polygon feature. Both parts are composed of four points.
