Specify whether the direction of travel used to generate the service area polygons is toward or away from the facilities.

This parameter is specified using the following values:

<If c="requestType == 'job'">
-   `Away from Facility`—The service area is generated in the direction away from the facilities.
-   `Towards Facility`—The service area is generated in the direction toward the facilities. 
</If>

<If c="requestType == 'direct'">
-   `esriNATravelDirectionFromFacility`—The service area is generated in the direction away from the facilities.
-   `esriNATravelDirectionToFacility`—The service area is generated in the direction toward the facilities.
</If>

The direction of travel may change the shape of the polygons because impedances on opposite sides of streets may differ or one-way restrictions may exist, such as one-way streets. The direction you should choose depends on the nature of your service area analysis. The service area for a pizza delivery store, for example, should be created away from the facility, whereas the service area of a hospital should be created toward the facility.
