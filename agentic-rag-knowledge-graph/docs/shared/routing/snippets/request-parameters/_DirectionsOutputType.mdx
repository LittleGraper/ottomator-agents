**Allowed values:** `esriDOTComplete`,`esriDOTCompleteNoEvents`, `esriDOTInstructionsOnly`, `esriDOTStandard`, `esriDOTSummaryOnly`, `esriDOTFeatureSets`

Specify the content and verbosity of the driving directions. 

This parameter applies only when the `returnDirections` parameter is set to `true` and can be specified using the following values: 

-   `esriDOTComplete`—The directions output includes all directions properties.
-   `esriDOTCompleteNoEvents`—The directions output includes all directions properties except events.
-   `esriDOTInstructionsOnly`—The directions output includes text instructions, time, length and ETA. The directions do not include geometry.
-   `esriDOTStandard`—The directions output includes text instructions, time, length, ETA, and geometry. The directions do not include events, new types of strings (street names, signposts information), maneuver type, bearings, or turn angle.
-   `esriDOTSummaryOnly`—The directions output contains a summary (time and length). Detailed text instructions and geometry are not included.
-   `esriDOTFeatureSets`—The directions output includes two feature sets: direction points and direction lines. The direction points set contains point features representing the direction maneuvers such as arriving to or departing from a stop, turning left or right, and other events along the route. This feature set also contains the route's turn-by-turn directions. The direction lines set contains line features for each segment of the route. This feature set can be used to visualize the turn-by-turn directions on a map.
