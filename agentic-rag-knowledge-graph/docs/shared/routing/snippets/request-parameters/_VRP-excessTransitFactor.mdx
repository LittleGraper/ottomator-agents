**Allowed values:** `Low`, `Medium`, `High`

Use this parameter to rate the importance of reducing excess transit time of order pairs. Excess transit time is the amount of time exceeding the time required to travel directly between the paired orders. Excess time can be caused by driver breaks or travel to intermediate orders and depots.

_Calculating excess transit time_

The parameter is specified using one of the following values:

-   `Low`—The service tries to find a solution that minimizes overall solution cost, regardless of excess transit time. This value is commonly used with courier services. Since couriers transport packages as opposed to people, they don't need to worry about ride time. Using `Low`  allows the couriers to service paired orders in the proper sequence and minimize the overall solution cost.
-   `Medium`—The service looks for a balance between reducing excess transit time and reducing the overall solution cost.
-   `High`—The service tries to find a solution with the least excess transit time between paired orders at the expense of increasing the overall travel costs. It makes sense to use this value if you are transporting people between paired orders and you want to shorten their ride time. This is characteristic of taxi services.

The vehicle routing problem solution can change according to the value you choose for the `excess_transit_factor` parameter. The next two images show the same set of orders and depots; however, the routes are not the same because different `excess_transit_factor` values were used. The image on the left shows the route that resulted when the `excess_transit_factor` parameter was set to `Low` . The overall route is short, but the travel time from the first order to its paired order, the airport, is long. If the `excess_transit_factor` is set to `High`, the route reduces the time between the first order and the airport while maintaining the same ride time to the airport for the order on the right; however, the overall cost of the route increases.
