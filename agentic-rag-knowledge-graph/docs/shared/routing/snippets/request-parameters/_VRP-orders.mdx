Specify one or more locations that the routes of the VRP analysis will visit. An order can represent a delivery (for example, furniture delivery), a pickup (such as an airport shuttle bus picking up a passenger), or some type of service or inspection (a tree trimming job or building inspection, for instance).

When specifying the orders, you can set attributes for each as follows:

<details>
 <summary><span class="font-sm text-color-link">Show attributes for orders</span></summary>

 #### Attributes for orders

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ObjectID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span></p>

    The system-managed ID field.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Name</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 500)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The name of the order. The name must be unique. If the name is left null, a name is automatically generated at solve time.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Description</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 500)</span></p>

    The descriptive information about the order. This can contain any textual information for the order and has no restrictions for uniqueness. You may want to store a client's ID number in the `Name` field and the client's actual name or address in the `Description` field.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ServiceTime</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The amount of time that will be spent at the network location when the route visits it; that is, it stores the impedance value for the network location. A zero or null value indicates that the network location requires no service time.

    The unit for this field value is specified by the [`time_units`](#time_units) parameter.

    The beginning time of the first time window for the network location. This field can contain a null value; a null value indicates no beginning time.

    A time window only states when a vehicle can arrive at an order; it doesn't state when the service time must be completed. To account for service time and departure before the time window ends, subtract `ServiceTime` from the `TimeWindowEnd1` field.

    The time window fields (`TimeWindowStart1`, `TimeWindowEnd1`, `TimeWindowStart2`, and `TimeWindowEnd2`) must be specified in a date field as an integer that represents the number of milliseconds since epoch (January 1, 1970) and not as date-time values. The time zone for time window fields is specified using the [`time_zone_usage_for_time_fields`](#time_zone_usage_for_time_fields) parameter. For example, if the orders are located in the Pacific standard time zone and you want to specify that the time window should start at 8:00 a.m. (local time) on November 18, 2019, the value for the `TimeWindowStart1` field should be specified as milliseconds since epoch for this date and time, which is 1574064000000. You also should specify the `time_zone_usage_for_time_fields` parameter value as `GEO_LOCAL`.

    When solving a problem that spans multiple time zones, each order's time-window values refer to the time zone in which the order is located.

    The beginning time of the second time window for the network location. This field can contain a null value; a null value indicates that there is no second time window.

    If the first time window is null as specified by the `TimeWindowStart1` and `TimeWindowEnd1` fields, the second time window must also be null. If both time windows are non null, they can't overlap. Also, the second time window must occur after the first.

    The ending time of the second time window for the network location. This field can contain a null value.

    When `TimeWindowStart2` and `TimeWindowEnd2` are both null, there is no second time window. When `TimeWindowStart2` is not null but `TimeWindowEnd2` is null, there is a second time window that has a starting time but no ending time. This is valid.

    A time window is considered violated if the arrival time occurs after the time window has ended. This field specifies the maximum allowable violation time for the first time window of the order. It can contain a zero value but can't contain negative values. A zero value indicates that a time window violation at the first time window of the order is unacceptable; that is, the first time window is hard. Conversely, a null value indicates that there is no limit on the allowable violation time. A nonzero value specifies the maximum amount of lateness; for example, a route can arrive at an order up to 30 minutes beyond the end of its first time window.

    The unit for this field value is specified by the [`time_units`](#time_units) parameter.

    Time window violations can be tracked and weighted by the solver. Consequently, you can direct the VRP solver to do one of the following:

    -    Minimize the overall violation time regardless of the increase in travel cost for the fleet.
    -    Find a solution that balances overall violation time and travel cost.
    -    Ignore the overall violation time and minimize the travel cost for the fleet.

    By assigning an importance level for the [`time_window_factor`](#time_window_factor) parameter, you are essentially choosing one of these options. In any case, however, the solver will return an error if the value set for `MaxViolationTime1` is surpassed.

    Defines when the item to be delivered to the order will be ready at the starting depot.

    <Note type={"note"}>

    The VRP solver honors `InboundArriveTime` regardless of the `DeliveryQuantities` value.

    </Note>

    The order can be assigned to a route only if the inbound arrive time precedes the route's latest start time value; this way, the route cannot leave the depot before the item is ready to be loaded onto it.

    <Note type={"note"}>

    The route's start time, which includes service times, must occur after the inbound arrive time. If a route begins before an order's inbound arrive time, the order cannot be assigned to the route. The assignment is invalid even if the route has a start-depot service time that lasts until after the inbound arrive time. If an outbound depart time is also specified, its time value must occur after the inbound arrive time.

    </Note>

    This field can help model scenarios involving inbound-wave transshipments. For example, a job at an order requires special materials that are not currently available at the depot. The materials are being shipped from another location and will arrive at the depot at 11:00 a.m. To ensure a route that leaves before the shipment arrives isn't assigned to the order, the order's inbound arrive time is set to 11:00 a.m. The special materials arrive at 11:00 a.m., they are loaded onto the vehicle, and the vehicle departs from the depot to visit its assigned orders.

    <Note type={"note"}>

    This time field can contain a time-only value or a date and time value. If a time-only value is set (for example, 11:00 AM), the date is assumed to be the default date set for the analysis. The default date is ignored, however, when any time field in the Depots, Routes, Orders, or Breaks includes a date with the time. In that case, specify all such fields with a date and time (for example, 7/11/2015 11:00 AM).

    This field can help model scenarios involving outbound-wave transshipments. For instance, a shipping company sends out delivery trucks to pick up packages from orders and bring them into a depot where they are forwarded on to other facilities, en route to their final destination. At 3:00 p.m. every day, a semitrailer stops at the depot to pick up the high-priority packages and take them directly to a central processing station. To avoid delaying the high-priority packages until the next day's 3:00 p.m. trip, the shipping company tries to have delivery trucks pick up the high-priority packages from orders and bring them to the depot before the 3:00 p.m. deadline. This is done by setting the outbound depart time to 3:00 p.m.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">DeliveryQuantities</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 500)</span></p> 

    The size of the delivery. You can specify size in any dimension, such as weight, volume, or quantity. You can also specify multiple dimensions, for example, weight and volume.

    Enter delivery quantities without indicating units. For example, if a 300-pound object needs to be delivered to an order, enter 300. You will need to remember that the value is in pounds.

    If you are tracking multiple dimensions, separate the numeric values with a space. For example, if you are recording the weight and volume of a delivery that weighs 2,000 pounds and has a volume of 100 cubic feet, enter 2000 100. Again, you need to remember the units—in this case, pounds and cubic feet. You also need to remember the sequence in which the values and their corresponding units are entered.

    Make sure that `Capacities` for Routes and `DeliveryQuantities` and `PickupQuantities` for Orders are specified in the same manner; that is, the values must be in the same units. If you are using multiple dimensions, the dimensions must be listed in the same sequence for all parameters. For example, if you specify weight in pounds, followed by volume in cubic feet for `DeliveryQuantities` , the capacity of your routes and the pickup quantities of your orders must be specified the same way: weight in pounds, then volume in cubic feet. If you combine units or change the sequence, you will get unwanted results with no warning messages.

    An empty string or null value is equivalent to all dimensions being infinity. If the string has an insufficient number of values in relation to the capacity count or dimensions being tracked, the remaining values are treated as infinity. Delivery quantities can't be negative.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">PickupQuantities</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 500)</span></p> 

    The size of the pickup. You can specify size in any dimension, such as weight, volume, or quantity. You can also specify multiple dimensions, for example, weight and volume. You cannot, however, use negative values. This field is analogous to the `DeliveryQuantities` field of Orders.

    In the case of an exchange visit, an order can have both delivery and pickup quantities.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Revenue</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p> 

    The income generated if the order is included in a solution. This field can contain a null value—a null value indicates zero revenue—but it can't have a negative value.

    Revenue is included in optimizing the objective function value but is not part of the solution's operating cost; that is, the `TotalCost` field in the routes never includes revenue in its output. However, revenue weights the relative importance of servicing orders. 

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">SpecialtyNames</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 500)</span></p> 

    A space-separated string containing the names of the specialties required by the order. A null value indicates that the order doesn't require specialties.

    The spelling of any specialties listed in the Orders and Routes classes must match exactly so that the VRP solver can link them together.

    To illustrate what specialties are and how they work, assume a lawn care and tree trimming company has a portion of its orders that requires a bucket truck to trim tall trees. The company enters BucketTruck in the `SpecialtyNames`  field for these orders to indicate their special need. `SpecialtyNames`  is left null for the other orders. Similarly, the company also enters BucketTruck in the `SpecialtyNames`  field of routes that are driven by trucks with hydraulic booms. It leaves the field null for the other routes. At solve time, the VRP solver assigns orders without special needs to any route, but it only assigns orders that need bucket trucks to routes that have them.

    Allowed values: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`

    This attribute specifies the rule for the order's route assignment options. It is constrained by a domain of values, that are listed below:

    - `0`: Exclude—The order will be excluded from the subsequent solve operation.
    - `1`: Preserve Route and Relative Sequence—The solver must always assign the order to the preassigned route at the preassigned relative sequence during the solve operation. If this assignment rule can't be followed, it results in an order violation. With this setting, only the relative sequence is maintained, not the absolute sequence. To illustrate what this means, imagine there are two orders: A and B. They have sequence values of 2 and 3, respectively. If you set their `AssignmentRule` field values to `Preserve Route and Relative Sequence`, the sequence values for A and B may change after solving because other orders, breaks, and depot visits can be sequenced before, between, or after A and B. However, B cannot be sequenced before A.
    - `2`: Preserve Route—The solver must always assign the order to the preassigned route during the solve operation. A valid sequence must also be set even though the sequence may or may not be preserved. If the order can't be assigned to the specified route, it results in an order violation.
    - `3`: Override—The solver tries to preserve the route and sequence preassignment for the order during the solve operation. However, a new route or sequence for the order may be assigned if it helps minimize the overall value of the objective function. 
    - `4`: Anchor first—The solver ignores the route and sequence preassignment (if any) for the order during the solve operation. It assigns a route to the order and makes it the first order on that route to minimize the overall value of the objective function.
    - `5`: Anchor last—The solver ignores the route and sequence preassignment (if any) for the order during the solve operation. It assigns a route to the order and makes it the last order on that route to minimize the overall value of the objective function.

    This field can't contain a null value.

    Allowed values: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`

    Specify the direction a vehicle may arrive at and depart from the order. The options are as following:

    - `0`: Either side of vehicle. The vehicle can approach and depart the order in either direction. U-turns are allowed. You should choose this setting if your vehicle can make a U-turn at the order or if it can pull into a driveway or parking lot and turn around.
    - `1`: Right side of vehicle. When the vehicle approaches and departs the order, the curb must be on the right side of the vehicle. A U-turn is prohibited.
    - `2`: Left side of vehicle. When the vehicle approaches and departs the order, the curb must be on the left side of the vehicle. A U-turn is prohibited.
    - `3`: No U-turn. When the vehicle approaches the order, the curb can be on either side of the vehicle; however, the vehicle must depart without turning around. [Learn more about U-turn policies](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/networks/u-turn-policies.htm)

        When the vehicle approaches the order, the order can be on either side of the vehicle; however, when it departs, the vehicle must continue in the same direction it arrived in. A U-turn is prohibited.

        The `CurbApproach`  attribute is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider an order on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards is your decision to approach an order from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at an order and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the order, choose 1 (Right side of vehicle) in the United States and 2 (Left side of vehicle) in the United Kingdom.

    The name of the route to which the order is assigned.

    This field is used to preassign an order to a specific route. It can contain a null value, indicating that the order is not preassigned to any route, and the solver identifies the best possible route assignment for the order. If this is set to null, the `Sequence` field must also be set to null. 

    After a solve operation, if the order is routed, the `RouteName` field contains the name of the route to which the order is assigned.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Sequence</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span></p> 

    Indicates the sequence of the order on its assigned route.

    This field is used to specify the relative sequence of an order on the route. This field can contain a null value specifying that the order can be placed anywhere along the route. A null value can only occur together with a null `RouteName` value. 

    The input sequence values are positive and unique for each route (shared across renewal depot visits, orders, and breaks) but do not need to start from 1 or be contiguous.

    After a solve operation, the `Sequence` field contains the sequence value of the order on its assigned route. Output sequence values for a route are shared across depot visits, orders, and breaks; start from 1 (at the starting depot); and are consecutive. The smallest possible output sequence value for a routed order is 2, since a route always begins at a depot.
