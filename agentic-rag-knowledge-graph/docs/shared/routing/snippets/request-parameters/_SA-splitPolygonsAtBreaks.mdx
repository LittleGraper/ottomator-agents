Specify whether multiple service areas around a facility are created as disks or rings.

-   `true`—When creating multiple service areas around a facility, do not include the region covered by the smaller service area in the region covered by the larger service area. Use this option to find the area from one break to another. For example, If you create 5- and 10-minute service areas, the 10-minute service areas will exclude the area under the 5-minute service areas and will appear like rings. 
-   `false`—When creating multiple service areas around a facility, create service areas going from the facility to the break. For example, If you create 5- and 10-minute service areas, the 10-minute service area will include the area under the 5-minute service area.

<Note type={"note"}>

Using either option will produce the same result when only one break value is specified.
