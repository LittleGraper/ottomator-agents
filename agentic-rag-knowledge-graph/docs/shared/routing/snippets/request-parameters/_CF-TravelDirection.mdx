<ParamMetadata types={[{name:"string"}]} defaultValue="Incident to Facility" />

**Allowed values:** `Facility to Incident`, `Incident to Facility`

Specify how the travel direction for the closest facility search will be measured.

This parameter can be specified using the following values:

-   `Facility to Incident` —Direction of travel is from facilities to incidents.
-   `Incident to Facility` —Direction of travel is from incidents to facilities.

Using one of the parameter values can find different facilities because the travel time along some streets may vary based on traffic and one-way restrictions. For instance, a facility may be a 10-minute drive from the incident while traveling from the incident to the facility, but while traveling from the facility to the incident, it may be a 15-minute journey because traffic is slower in that direction. If you're setting a value for `time_of_day`, traffic may also cause the `Facility to Incident` and `Incident to Facility` options to return different results.

Fire departments commonly use the `Facility to Incident` value for the parameter since they're concerned with the time it takes to travel from the fire station (facility) to the location of the emergency (incident). A retail store (facility) is more concerned with the time it takes the shoppers (incidents) to reach the store; therefore, stores commonly use the `Incident to Facility`  parameter value.

<ParamMetadata types={[{name:"string"}]} defaultValue="esriNATravelDirectionToFacility" />

**Allowed values:** `esriNATravelDirectionFromFacility`,`esriNATravelDirectionToFacility`

Specify how the travel direction for the closest facility search will be measured.

This parameter can be specified using the following values:

-   `esriNATravelDirectionFromFacility` —The direction of travel is from facilities to incidents.
-   `esriNATravelDirectionToFacility` —The direction of travel is from incidents to facilities.

Each option may find different facilities, as the travel time along some streets may vary based on the travel direction and one-way restrictions. For instance, a facility may be a 10-minute drive from the incident while traveling from the incident to the facility, but while traveling from the facility to the incident, it may be a 15-minute drive because of different travel time in that direction. 

Fire departments commonly use the `esriNATravelDirectionFromFacility` value for the parameter since they are concerned with the time it takes to travel from the fire station (facility) to the location of the emergency (incident). A retail store (facility) is more concerned with the time it takes the shoppers (incidents) to reach the store; retail stores commonly use the `esriNATravelDirectionToFacility` parameter value.
