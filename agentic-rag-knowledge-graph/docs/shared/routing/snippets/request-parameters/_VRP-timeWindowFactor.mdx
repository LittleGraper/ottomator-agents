**Allowed values:** `Low`, `Medium`, `High`

Specify the importance of honoring time windows without causing violations. A time window violation occurs when a route arrives at an order, depot, or break after a time window has closed. The parameter is specified using one of the following values:

-   `Low`—Places more importance on minimizing drive times and less on arriving at stops on time. You may want to use this value if you have a growing backlog of service requests. For the purpose of servicing more orders in a day and reducing the backlog, you can choose `Low` even though customers might be inconvenienced with your late arrivals.
-   `Medium`—Balances the importance of minimizing drive times and arriving within time windows.
-   `High`—Places more importance on arriving at stops on time than on minimizing drive times. Organizations that make time-critical deliveries or that are very concerned with customer service would choose a value of `High`.

The vehicle routing problem solution can change according to the value you choose for the `time_window_factor` parameter. The next two images show the same set of orders and depots; however, the routes are not the same because different `time_window_factor` values were used. The image on the left shows the route that resulted from the `time_window_factor` parameter set to `Low`. The route is short, but it has a time window violation. If `time_window_factor` is set to `High`, the route meets all the time windows, but it is longer because it services the order with a time window first.
