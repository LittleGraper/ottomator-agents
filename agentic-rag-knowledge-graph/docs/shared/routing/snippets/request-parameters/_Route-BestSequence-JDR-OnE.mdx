Specify whether the service should reorder stops to find the optimized route. 

-   `false` —The service returns a route that visits stops in the order you define. 
-   `true` —The service finds the best order to visit the stops. The service will account for a variety of variables so that the total travel distance or travel time for the route is minimized. 


<If c="requestType == 'job'">
You can elect to preserve the first and last stops while allowing the service to reorder intermediary stops by setting the `preserve_terminal_stops` parameter.
</If>

<If c="requestType == 'direct'">
You can preserve the origin and the destination stops while allowing the service to reorder intermediary stops by setting the `preserveFirstStop` and `preserveLastStop` parameters.
</If>

<Note type={"note"}>

A `true` parameter value causes the service to switch from solving a shortest-path problem to a traveling salesperson problem (TSP). Solving a TSP is a computer-intensive operation and incurs additional service credits per route.
