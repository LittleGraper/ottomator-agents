Specify whether barriers will be returned by the service

-   `true`—The input point barriers are returned as part of the `barriers` property in the JSON response.
-   `false`—Point barriers are not returned.

For this parameter to take effect, you must also specify a value for the `barriers` parameter.

If you specified the [`barriers`](#barriers) parameter value using a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set, you can set the `returnBarriers` parameter to `true` so you can draw the point barrier locations in the application. You can also set the `returnBarriers` property to `true` to see where the barriers were located on the street network or, if they weren't located, understand what the problem was by reviewing the `Status` property in the JSON response.
