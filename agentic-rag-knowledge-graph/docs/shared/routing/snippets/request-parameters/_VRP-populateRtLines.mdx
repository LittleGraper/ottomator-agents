Specify the shape of the output routes.

-   `true`—The output routes will have the exact shape of the underlying streets that are included in the routes.
-   `false`—No shape is generated for the output routes. You won't be able to generate driving directions if the `populate_route_lines` parameter is set to `false`. Use this option if you are only interested in determining the assignment and sequence of orders to the routes and do not want route shapes that follow streets or generate driving directions. Use this option to reduce the time taken by the service to solve the vehicle routing problem, as the service has to perform relatively fewer computations.
