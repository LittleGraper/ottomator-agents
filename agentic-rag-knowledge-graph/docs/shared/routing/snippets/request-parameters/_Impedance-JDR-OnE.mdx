Impedance is a value that quantifies travel along the transportation network. Travel distance is an example of impedance; it quantifies the length of walkways and road segments. Similarly, drive time—the typical time it takes to drive a car along a road segment—is an example of impedance. Drive times may vary by type of vehicle—for instance, the time it takes for a truck to travel along a path tends to be longer than a car—so there can be many impedance values representing travel times for different vehicle types. Impedance values may also vary with time; live and typical traffic reference dynamic impedance values. Each walkway and road segment stores at least one impedance value. When performing a network analysis, the impedance values are used to calculate the best results, such as finding the shortest route—the route that minimizes impedance—between two points.

The parameter can be specified using the following values:

-   `TravelTime`—Historical and live traffic data is used. This option is good for modeling the time it takes automobiles to travel along roads at a specific time of day using live traffic speed data where available. When using `TravelTime`, you can optionally set the TravelTime::Vehicle Maximum Speed (km/h) attribute parameter to specify the physical limitation of the speed the vehicle is capable of traveling.
-   `Minutes`—Live traffic data is not used, but historical average speeds for automobiles data is used.
-   `TruckTravelTime`—Historical and live traffic data is used, but the speed is capped at the posted truck speed limit. This is good for modeling the time it takes for the trucks to travel along roads at a specific time. When using `TruckTravelTime`, you can optionally set the TruckTravelTime::Vehicle Maximum Speed (km/h) attribute parameter to specify the physical limitation of the speed the truck is capable of traveling.
-   `TruckMinutes`—Live traffic data is not used, but the smaller of the historical average speeds for automobiles and the posted speed limits for trucks are used.
-   `WalkTime`—The default is a speed of 5 km/hr on all roads and paths, but this can be configured through the WalkTime::Walking Speed (km/h) attribute parameter.
-   `Miles`—Length measurements along roads are stored in miles and can be used for performing analysis based on shortest distance.
-   `Kilometers`—Length measurements along roads are stored in kilometers and can be used for performing analysis based on shortest distance.

If you choose a time-based impedance, such as `TravelTime`, `TruckTravelTime`, `Minutes`, `TruckMinutes`, or `WalkTime`, the `measurement_units` parameter must be set to a time-based value; if you choose a distance-based impedance such as `Miles`, `Kilometers`, the `measurement_units` must be distance-based.

<Note type={"note"}>

`Drive Time`, `Truck Time`, `Walk Time`, and `Travel Distance` impedance values are no longer supported and will be removed in a future release.
