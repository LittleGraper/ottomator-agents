Specify whether the service should generate edges for each route. Route edges represent the individual street features or other similar features, such as trails, that are traversed by a route. The output route edges is commonly used to see which streets are traveled on the most or least by the resultant routes.

-   `true`—The service will generate route edges.
-   `false`—Route edges will not be generated by the service.
