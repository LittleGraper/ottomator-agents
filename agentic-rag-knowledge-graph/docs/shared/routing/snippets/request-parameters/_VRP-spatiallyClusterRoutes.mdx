Specify if orders assigned to an individual route are spatially clustered.

-   `true`—Indicates that the orders assigned to an individual route are spatially clustered by automatically creating dynamic seed points for all the routes. Clustering orders usually results in routes that cover a smaller area and don't intersect other routes as much, but the overall cost of the solution could be more. You might want to cluster orders to keep drivers in general neighborhoods or regions that they are familiar with, or you might want to have compartmentalized routes if they are easier for your organization to manage. 
-   `false`—Indicates that the orders assigned to an individual route are not spatially clustered. Use this value if you have predefined work territories for the routes that are specified using the [`route_zones`](#route_zones) parameter.
