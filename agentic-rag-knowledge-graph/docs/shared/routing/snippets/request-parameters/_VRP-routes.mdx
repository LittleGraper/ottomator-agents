<ParamMetadata types={[{name:"table",link:"../routing-data-types#table"}]} />

Specify one or more routes that describe vehicle and driver characteristics. A route can have start and end depot service times, a fixed or flexible starting time, time-based operating costs, distance-based operating costs, multiple capacities, various constraints on a driver's workday, and so on. 

You can specify additional properties for routes with the following attributes:

<details>
 <summary><span class="font-sm text-color-link">Show attributes for routes</span></summary>

 #### Attributes for routes

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Name</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 1024)</span></p>

    The name of the route. The name must be unique.

    The service generates a unique name if the attribute value is null. Therefore, specifying a value is optional in most cases. However, you must specify a name if your analysis includes breaks, route renewals, route zones, or orders that are preassigned to a route because the route name is used as a foreign key in these cases. Note that route names are case insensitive.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">StartDepotName</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 500)</span></p>

    The name of the starting depot for the route. This attribute is a foreign key to the `Name` attribute in the [`depots`](#depots) parameter, so the values must match.

    If the `StartDepotName`  value is null, the route will begin from the first order assigned. Omitting the start depot is useful when the vehicle's starting location is unknown or irrelevant to your problem. However, when `StartDepotName` is null, `EndDepotName` cannot also be null.

    Virtual start depots are not allowed if orders or depots are in multiple time zones.

    If the route is making deliveries and `StartDepotName`is null, it is assumed the cargo is loaded on the vehicle at a virtual depot before the route begins. For a route that has no renewal visits, its delivery orders (those with nonzero `DeliveryQuantities` values in the [`orders`](#orders) parameter) are loaded at the start depot or virtual depot. For a route that has renewal visits, only the delivery orders before the first renewal visit are loaded at the start depot or virtual depot.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">EndDepotName</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 500)</span></p>

    The name of the ending depot for the route. This attribute is a foreign key to the `Name` attribute in the [`depots`](#depots) parameter, so the values must match.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">StartDepotServiceTime</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    The service time at the starting depot. This can be used to model the time spent loading the vehicle. This attribute can contain a null value; a null value indicates zero service time. The unit for this attribute value is specified by the [`time_units`](#time_units) parameter.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">EndDepotServiceTime</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    The service time at the ending depot. This can be used to model the time spent unloading the vehicle. This attribute can contain a null value; a null value indicates zero service time. The unit for this attribute value is specified by the [`time_units`](#time_units) parameter.

    The service times at the start and end depots are fixed values (given by the `StartDepotServiceTime` and `EndDepotServiceTime` attribute values) and do not take into account the actual load for a route. For example, the time taken to load a vehicle at the starting depot may depend on the size of the orders. Therefore, the depot service times could be given values corresponding to a full truckload or an average truckload, or you could make your own time estimate.

<If c="requestType == 'job'">

    The earliest allowable starting time for the route. This is used by the service in conjunction with the time window of the starting depot for determining feasible route start times. 

    This attribute can't contain null values and has a default time-only value of 8:00 AM on the date given by the `default_date`  parameter or the current date if unspecified.
</If>

<If c="requestType == 'direct'">

    The earliest allowable starting time for the route. This is used by the service in conjunction with the time window of the starting depot for determining feasible route start times. 

    This attribute can't contain null values and has a default time-only value of 8:00 AM on the date given by the `default_date`  parameter or the current date if unspecified.

    The latest allowable starting time for the route. This attribute can't contain null values and has a default time-only value of 10:00 AM; the default value is interpreted as 10:00 a.m. on the date given by the [`default_date`](#default_date) parameter.

    The value for the `EarliestStartTime` and `LatestStartTime` attributes is specified in a date field as an integer that represents the number of milliseconds since epoch (January 1, 1970). 

    The time zone is specified using the [`time_zone_usage_for_time_fields`](#time_zone_usage_for_time_fields) parameter. If set to `GEO_LOCAL`, the time is in the time zone where the route's depot is located. This is useful if your routes span multiple time zones but they all start at a consistent time (for example, 8:00 a.m. in the depot's time zone). If the parameter is set to `UTC`, the time is based on UTC time. This is useful if you don't know the time zone of an individual route's depot but know its absolute time (for example, the time window starts an hour from now).

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ArriveDepartDelay</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    Stores the amount of travel time needed to accelerate the vehicle to normal travel speeds, decelerate it to a stop, and move it off and on the network (for example, in and out of parking). By including an `ArriveDepartDelay` value, the service is deterred from sending many routes to service physically coincident orders. 

    The cost for this attribute is incurred between visits to noncoincident orders, depots, and route renewals. For example, when a route starts from a depot and visits the first order, the total arrive/depart delay is added to the travel time. The same is true when traveling from the first order to the second order. If the second and third orders are coincident, the `ArriveDepartDelay`  value is not added between them because the vehicle doesn't need to move. If the route travels to a route renewal, the value is added to the travel time again.

    Although a vehicle needs to slow down and stop for a break and accelerate afterward, the service cannot add the `ArriveDepartDelay` value for breaks. This means that if a route leaves an order, stops for a break, and continues to the next order, the arrive/depart delay is added only once, not twice.

    To illustrate, assume there are five coincident orders in a high-rise building, and they are serviced by three different routes. This means three arrive/depart delays would be incurred; that is, three drivers would need to separately find parking places and enter the same building. However, if the orders could be serviced by just one route instead, only one driver would need to park and enter the buildingâ€”only one arrive/depart delay would be incurred. Since the service tries to minimize cost, it will try to limit the arrive/depart delays and thus choose the single-route option. (Note that multiple routes may need to be sent when other constraintsâ€”such as specialties, time windows, or capacitiesâ€”require it.)

    The unit for this attribute value is specified by the [`time_units`](#time_units) parameter.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Capacities</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 128)</span></p>

    The maximum capacity of the vehicle. You can specify capacity in any dimension you want, such as weight, volume, or quantity. You can even specify multiple dimensions, for example, weight and volume. 

    Specify capacities without indicating units. For example, assume your vehicle can carry a maximum of 40,000 pounds; you would specify `40000` as the value for the `Capacities`  attribute. You need to remember for future reference that the value is in pounds.

    If you are tracking multiple dimensions, separate the numeric values with a space. For instance, if you are recording both weight and volume and your vehicle can carry a maximum weight of 40,000 pounds and a maximum volume of 2,000 cubic feet, `Capacities` should be specified as `40000 2000`. Again, you need to remember the units. You also need to remember the sequence in which the values and their corresponding units are specified (pounds followed by cubic feet in this case).

    Remembering the units and the unit sequence is important for a couple of reasons: first, so you can reinterpret the information later, and second, so you can properly enter values for the `DeliveryQuantities` and `PickupQuantities` attributes in the [`orders`](#orders) parameter. To elaborate on the second point, note that the service simultaneously refers to `Capacities`, `DeliveryQuantities`, and `PickupQuantities` attributes to make sure that a route doesn't become overloaded. Since units can't be entered in the field, the service can't make unit conversions, so you need to specify the values for the three attributes using the same units and the same unit sequence to ensure the values are correctly interpreted. If you mix units or change the sequence in any of the three attributes, you will get unwanted results without receiving any warning messages. Thus, it is a good idea to set up a unit and unit-sequence standard beforehand and continually refer to it whenever specifying values for these three attributes. 

    <Note type={"note"}>

    An empty string or null value is equivalent to infinity. Capacity values can't be negative.

    </Note>

    If the `Capacities`  string has an insufficient number of values in relation to the `DeliveryQuantities` or `PickupQuantities` attributes in the [`orders`](#orders) parameter, the unspecified values are treated as infinity.

    <Note type={"caution"}>

    The service only performs a simple Boolean test to determine whether capacities are exceeded. If a route's capacity value is greater than or equal to the total quantity being carried, the service will assume the cargo fits in the vehicle. This could be incorrect, depending on the actual shape of the cargo and the vehicle. For example, the service allows you to fit a 1,000-cubic-foot sphere into a 1,000-cubic-foot truck that is 8 feet wide. In reality, however, since the sphere is 12.6 feet in diameter, it won't fit in the 8-foot wide truck.

    </Note>

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">FixedCost</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    A fixed monetary cost that is incurred only if the route is used in a solution (that is, it has orders assigned to it). This attribute can contain null values; a null value indicates zero fixed cost. This cost is part of the total route operating cost.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">CostPerUnitTime</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    The monetary cost incurred (per unit of work time) for the total route duration, including travel times as well as service times and wait times at orders, depots, and breaks. This attribute can't contain a null value and has a default value of 1.0. The unit for this attribute value is specified by the [`time_units`](#time_units) parameter.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">CostPerUnitDistance</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    The monetary cost incurredâ€”per unit of distance traveledâ€”for the route length (total travel distance). This attribute can contain null values; a null value indicates zero cost. The unit for this attribute value is specified by the [`distance_units`](#distance_units) parameter.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">OverTimeStartTime</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    The duration of regular work time before overtime computation begins. This attribute can contain null values; a null value indicates that overtime does not apply. The unit for this attribute value is specified by the `time_units` parameter.

    For example, if the driver is to be paid overtime pay when the total route duration extends beyond eight hours, `OvertimeStartTime` is specified as `480` (8 hours \* 60 minutes/hour), given the [`time_units`](#time_units) parameter is set to `Minutes`.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">CostPerUnitOvertime</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    The monetary cost incurred per time unit of overtime work. This attribute can contain null values; a null value indicates that the `CostPerUnitOvertime` value is the same as the `CostPerUnitTime` value. The unit for this attribute value is specified by the [`time_units`](#time_units) parameter.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">MaxOrderCount</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span></p>

    The maximum allowable number of orders on the route. This attribute can't contain null values and has a default value of 30.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">MaxTotalTime</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    The maximum allowable route duration. The route duration includes travel times as well as service and wait times at orders, depots, and breaks. This attribute can contain null values; a null value indicates that there is no constraint on the route duration. The unit for this attribute value is specified by the [`time_units`](#time_units) parameter.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">MaxTotalTravelTime</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    The maximum allowable travel time for the route. The travel time includes only the time spent driving on the streets and does not include service or wait times. This attribute can contain null values; a null value indicates there is no constraint on the maximum allowable travel time. This attribute value can't be larger than the `MaxTotalTime` attribute value. The unit for this attribute value is specified by the [`time_units`](#time_units) parameter. 

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">MaxTotalDistance</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    The maximum allowable travel distance for the route. This attribute can contain null values; a null value indicates that there is no constraint on the maximum allowable travel distance. The unit for this attribute value is specified by the [`distance_units`](#distance_units) parameter.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">SpecialtyNames</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">str (length: 1024)</span></p>

    A space-separated string containing the names of the specialties supported by the route. A null value indicates that the route does not support any specialties. This attribute is a foreign key to the `SpecialtyNames` attribute in the [`orders`](#orders) parameter, so the values must match.

    To illustrate what specialties are and how they work, assume a lawn care and tree trimming company has a portion of its orders that requires a bucket truck to trim tall trees. The company would specify `BucketTruck` as the value for the `SpecialtyNames` attribute for these orders to indicate their special need. `SpecialtyNames` would be left as null for the other orders. Similarly, the company would also specify `BucketTruck` as the value for the `SpecialtyNames` attribute for the routes that are driven by trucks with hydraulic booms. It would leave the attribute value as null for the other routes. When finding the solution, the service assigns orders without special needs to any route, but it only assigns orders that need bucket trucks to routes that have them.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">AssignmentRule</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">int enum</span><span class="font-bold text-[#6d29cc]">default:1</span></p>

    Allowed values: `0`, `1`

    Specifies whether the route can be used or not when solving the problem. The attribute value should be specified as one of the following integer values:

    -   `0` â€”The route is excluded from the solution. 
    -   `1` â€”The route is included when finding the solution.
