<If c={props.route}>
Specify whether the object IDs specified for input locations such as stops or barriers will be preserved when the input locations are returned as output. This can be useful if you want to associate additional attributes with the output locations after the solve operation is successful and need a common key field to do the join.

For example, the input stops are specified as the following JSON representation of a feature set:

<CodeBlock language="json" source="../../code-samples/shared/examples/input/preserveObjectID_ex.json" maxLines={20} expandable/>

If you solve a route and specify `preserveObjectID=false`, the output stops will have object IDs of 1, 2, 3, and 4 even though the input stops have object IDs of 10, 20, 30, and 40. However, if `preserveObjectID=true`, the output stops will have the same object IDs as the inputs: 10, 20, 30, and 40.

</If>

<If c={props.closestFacility}>
Specify whether the object IDs specified for input locations such as facilities, incidents, or barriers will be preserved when the input locations are returned as output. This can be useful if you want to associate additional attributes with the output locations after the solve operation is successful and need a common key field to do the join.

For example, the input incidents are specified as the following JSON representation of a feature set:

<CodeBlock language="json" source="../../code-samples/shared/examples/input/preserveObjectID_CF_ex.json" maxLines={20} expandable/>

If you solve a closest facility and specify `preserveObjectID=false`, the output incidents will have object IDs of 1, 2 and the output facilities will have object IDs 1,2, even though the input incidents have object IDs of 10, 20 and the input facilities have object IDs 30,40. However, if `preserveObjectID=true`, the output incidents and facilities will preserve the object ID from the inputs.

</If>

<If c={props.serviceArea}>
Specify whether the object IDs specified for input locations such as facilities or barriers will be preserved when the input locations are returned as output. This can be useful if you want to associate additional attributes with the output locations after the solve operation is successful and need a common key field to do the join.

For example, the input facilities are specified as the following JSON representation of a feature set:

<CodeBlock language="json" source="../../code-samples/shared/examples/input/preserveObjectID_CF_ex.json" maxLines={20} expandable/>

If you solve a service area and specify `preserveObjectID=false`, the output facilities will have object IDs of 1, 2  even though the input facilities have object IDs of 10, 20. However, if `preserveObjectID=true`, the output facilities  will preserve the object ID from the inputs.

</If>

<Note type={"note"}>

The order in which the output locations are returned varies based on other parameters specified for the solve operation and should not be relied upon to correlate the output locations with input locations. Preserving the object ID is the best way to achieve this correlation. If the identifier for the input location can not be passed as an `ObjectID` value, for example, the identifier is not numeric, you can pass the identifier as the `Name` field and use the `Name` field on the output locations to correlate the input and output locations.

</Note>

<Note type={"note"}>

When `preserveObjectID=true`, the object ID values must be 1 or greater, must be specified for every feature, and must be unique.
