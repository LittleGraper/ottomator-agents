Specify whether facilities are returned by the service. 

-   `true`—The input facilities are returned as part of the `facilities`  property in the JSON response.
-   `false`—The input facilities are not included in the results.

If you specified the `facilities` parameter value using a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set, you can set the `returnFacilities` parameter to `true` so you can draw the facility locations in the application. You can also set the `returnFacilities` property to `true` to see where the facilities were located on the street network or if they weren't located, understand what the problem was by reviewing the `Status` property in the JSON response.
