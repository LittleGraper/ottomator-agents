Specify whether hierarchy will be used when finding the shortest paths.

The value of this parameter, regardless of whether you rely on the default or explicitly set a value, is overridden when `travel_mode` is set to any other value than `Custom` . The default value for `travel_mode` is `Driving` , so unless you set `travel_mode` to a different value, this parameter value will be overridden.

The value of this parameter, regardless of whether you use the default or explicitly set a value, is overridden when you pass in `travelMode`.

-   `true`—Use hierarchy when travelling between stops. When hierarchy is used, the service prefers higher-order streets (such as freeways) to lower-order streets (such as local roads) and can be used to simulate the driver preference of traveling on freeways instead of local roads even if that means a longer trip. This is especially true when finding routes to faraway locations, because drivers on long-distance trips tend to prefer traveling on freeways where stops, intersections, and turns can be avoided. Using hierarchy is computationally faster, especially for long-distance routes, since the service can determine the best route from a relatively smaller subset of streets.
-   `false`—Do not use hierarchy when travelling between stops. When hierarchy is not used, the service considers all the streets and doesn't prefer higher-order streets when finding the route. This is often used when finding short-distance routes within a city.

<If c="publication=='rest/online'">
<Note type={"note"}>
The service automatically reverts to using hierarchy if the straight-line distance between the stops is greater than 50 miles (80.46 kilometers), even if you have specified to find the route without using hierarchy.
