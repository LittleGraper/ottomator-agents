**Allowed values:** `Straight Line`, `None`

Specify the type of line features that are output by the service. The parameter accepts the following values:

-   `Straight Line`—Straight lines between solution facilities and the demand points allocated to them are returned. Drawing straight lines on a map helps you visualize how demand is allocated.
-   `None`—A table containing data about the shortest paths between solution facilities and the demand points allocated to them is returned; lines are not returned.

Regardless of the value you choose for the `allocation_line_shape` parameter, the shortest route is determined by minimizing the travel time or the travel distance, not using the straight-line distance between incidents and facilities. That is, this parameter only changes the output line shapes; it doesn't change the measurement method.
