Specify whether the service area lines from different facilities can overlap each other.

-   `true`—Services area lines can overlap one another. With this option, if two facilities have service area lines that are coincident, there are two features there—one for each facility's service area line. 
-   `false`—Service area lines from one facility cannot overlap those from another facility. With this option, if two facilities have service area lines that are coincident, there is only one service area line, and it is associated with the closest facility.

Setting this parameter has no effect when there is only one facility or `outputLines` is set to `esriNAOutputLineNone`.
