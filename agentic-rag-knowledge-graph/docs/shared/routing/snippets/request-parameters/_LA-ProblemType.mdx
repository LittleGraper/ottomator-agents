**Allowed values:** `Maximize Attendance`, `Maximize Capacitated Coverage`, `Maximize Coverage`, `Maximize Market Share`, `Minimize Facilities`, `Minimize Impedance`, `Target Market Share`

Specify the objective of the location-allocation analysis, which can be one of the following options:

-   `Maximize Attendance`—Facilities are chosen such that as much demand weight as possible is allocated to facilities while assuming the demand weight decreases in relation to the distance between the facility and the demand point.

    _Maximize Attendance chooses facilities such that as much demand weight as possible is allocated to facilities while assuming the demand weight decreases with distance. The demand points, represented by pie charts in this graphic, show how much of their total demand is captured by the facility._

    Specialty stores that have little or no competition benefit from this problem type, but it may also be beneficial to general retailers and restaurants that don't have the data on competitors necessary to perform market share problem types. Some businesses that might benefit from this problem type include coffee shops, fitness centers, dental and medical offices, and electronics stores. Public transit bus stops are often chosen with the help of Maximize Attendance. Maximize Attendance assumes that the farther people have to travel to reach your facility, the less likely they are to use it. This is reflected in how the amount of demand allocated to facilities diminishes with distance.

    The following list describes how the Maximize Attendance problem handles demand:

    -   A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated.
    -   When a demand point can reach a facility, its demand weight is only partially allocated to the facility. The amount allocated decreases as a function of the maximum cutoff distance (or time) and the travel distance (or time) between the facility and the demand point.
    -   The weight of a demand point that can reach more than one facility is proportionately allocated to the nearest facility only.

-   `Maximize Coverage`—Facilities are located such that as much demand as possible is allocated to solution facilities within the impedance cutoff.

    ![Maximize Coverage problem type](../../images/la_maxcoverage.png)

    _Maximize Coverage chooses facilities such that as much demand as possible is covered by the impedance cutoff of facilities. In this graphic, the task was directed to choose three facilities._

    <details>
    <summary><span class="font-sm text-color-link">Expand to learn more</span></summary>

    Maximize Coverage is frequently used to locate fire stations, police stations, and Emergency Response Services (ERS) centers, because emergency services are often required to arrive at all demand points within a specified response time. Note that it is important for all organizations, and critical for emergency services, to have accurate and precise data so that analysis results correctly model real-world results.

    Pizza delivery businesses, as opposed to eat-in pizzerias, try to locate stores where they can cover the most people within a certain drive time. People who order pizzas for delivery don't typically worry about how far away the pizzeria is; they are mainly concerned with the pizza arriving within an advertised time window. Therefore, a pizza delivery business would subtract pizza preparation time from its advertised delivery time and solve a maximize coverage problem to choose the candidate facility that would capture the most potential customers in the coverage area. (Potential customers of eat-in pizzerias are more affected by distance, since they need to travel to the restaurant; thus, the attendance maximizing or market share problem types would better suit eat-in restaurants.)

    The following list describes how the Maximize Coverage problem handles demand:

    -   A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to cutoff distance or time is not allocated.
    -   A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility.
    -   A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to the nearest facility only.

-   `Maximize Capacitated Coverage`—Facilities are located such that all or the greatest amount of demand can be served without exceeding the capacity of any facility.

    ![Maximize Capacitated Coverage problem type](../../images/la_MaxCapacitatedCov.png)

    _Maximize Capacitated Coverage chooses facilities such that all or the greatest amount of demand can be served without exceeding the capacity of any facility. In this graphic, each facility has a capacity of one, and the task was directed to choose three facilities. Although the demand point on the bottom of the map is within the impedance cutoff of a facility, it's not allocated, because doing so would surpass a facility's capacity._

    <details>
    <summary><span class="font-sm text-color-link">Expand to learn more</span></summary>

    Maximize Capacitated Coverage behaves like either the Minimize Impedance or Maximize Coverage problem type but with the added constraint of capacity. You can specify a capacity for an individual facility by assigning a numeric value to its corresponding `Capacity`  attribute on the input facilities. If the `Capacity`  attribute value is null, the facility is assigned a capacity from the `default_capacity`  property.

    Use cases for Maximize Capacitated Coverage include creating territories that encompass a given number of people or businesses, locating hospitals or other medical facilities with a limited number of beds or patients who can be treated, or locating warehouses whose inventory isn't assumed to be unlimited. 

    The following list describes how the Maximize Capacitated Coverage problem handles demand:

    -   Unlike Maximize Coverage, Maximize Capacitated Coverage doesn't require a value for the Default Measurement Cutoff; however, when a cutoff is specified, any demand point outside the cutoff time or distance of all facilities is not allocated.
    -   An allocated demand point has all or none of its demand weight assigned to a facility; that is, demand isn't apportioned with this problem type.
    -   If the total demand that can reach a facility is greater than the capacity of the facility, only the demand points that maximize total captured demand and minimize total weighted travel are allocated. 

    <Note type={"note"}>

    You may notice an apparent inefficiency when a demand point is allocated to a facility that isn't the nearest solution facility. This may occur when demand points have varying weights and when the demand point in question can reach more than one facility. This kind of result indicates the nearest solution facility didn't have adequate capacity for the weighted demand, or the most efficient solution for the entire problem required one or more local inefficiencies. In either case, the solution is correct.

-   `Maximize Market Share`—A specific number of facilities are chosen such that the allocated demand is maximized in the presence of competitors. The goal is to capture as much of the total market share as possible with a given number of facilities, which you specify. The total market share is the sum of all demand weight for valid demand points.

    ![Maximize Market Share problem type](../../images/la_maxmarketshare.png)

    _Maximize Market Share chooses facilities such that the largest amount of allocated demand is captured in the presence of competitors. You specify the number of facilities you want it to choose._

    <details>
    <summary><span class="font-sm text-color-link">Expand to learn more</span></summary>

    The market share problem types require the most data because, along with knowing your own facilities' weight, you also need to know that of your competitors' facilities. The same types of facilities that use the Maximize Attendance problem type can also use market share problem types, given that they have comprehensive information that includes competitor data. Large discount stores typically use Maximize Market Share to locate a finite set of new stores. The market share problem types use a Huff model, which is also known as a gravity model or spatial interaction.

    The following list describes how the Maximize Market Share problem handles demand:

    -   A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated.
    -   A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility.
    -   A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to them; furthermore, the weight is split among the facilities proportionally to the facilities' attractiveness (facility weight) and inversely proportional to the distance between the facility and demand point. Given equal facility weights, this means more demand weight is assigned to near facilities than far facilities. 
    -   The total market share, which can be used to calculate the captured market share, is the sum of the weight of all valid demand points.

-   `Minimize Facilities`—Facilities are chosen such that as much weighted demand as possible is allocated to solution facilities within the travel time or distance cutoff; additionally, the number of facilities required to cover demand is minimized.

    ![Minimize Facilities problem type](../../images/la_minfacilities.png)

    _Minimize Facilities chooses facilities such that as many demand points as possible are within the impedance cutoff of facilities. Additionally, the number of facilities required to cover all demand points is minimized. In this graphic, the task was able to cover all demand points with only two facilities._

    <details>
    <summary><span class="font-sm text-color-link">Expand to learn more</span></summary>

    Minimize Facilities is the same as Maximize Coverage but with the exception of the number of facilities to locate, which in this case is determined by the solver. When the cost of building facilities is not a limiting factor, the same kinds of organizations that use Maximize Coverage (emergency response, for instance) use Minimize Facilities so that all possible demand points will be covered. 

    The following list describes how the Minimize Facilities problem handles demand:

    -   A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated.
    -   A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility.
    -   A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to the nearest facility only.

    </details>

-   `Minimize Impedance`—This is also known as the P-Median problem type. Facilities are located such that the sum of all weighted travel time or distance between demand points and solution facilities is minimized. (Weighted travel is the amount of demand allocated to a facility multiplied by the travel distance or time to the facility.)

    ![Minimize Impedance problem type](../../images/la_minimize_impedance.png)

    _Minimize Impedance chooses facilities such that the sum of weighted impedances (demand allocated to a facility multiplied by the impedance to the facility) is minimized._

    <details>
    <summary><span class="font-sm text-color-link">Expand to learn more</span></summary>

    This problem type is traditionally used to locate warehouses, because it can reduce the overall transportation costs of delivering goods to outlets. Since Minimize Impedance reduces the overall distance the public needs to travel to reach the chosen facilities, the minimize impedance problem without an impedance cutoff is ordinarily regarded as more equitable than other problem types for locating some public-sector facilities such as libraries, regional airports, museums, department of motor vehicles offices, and health clinics.

    The following list describes how the minimize impedance problem type handles demand:

    -   A demand point that cannot reach any facilities, due to setting a cutoff distance or time, is not allocated.
    -   A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility.
    -   A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to the nearest facility only.

-   `Target Market Share`—Target Market Share chooses the minimum number of facilities necessary to capture a specific percentage of the total market share in the presence of competitors. The total market share is the sum of all demand weight for valid demand points. You set the percent of the market share you want to reach and let the solver choose the fewest number of facilities necessary to meet that threshold.

    ![Target Market Share problem type](../../images/la_targetmarketshare.png)

    _Target Market Share works in the presence of competitors and tries to choose the fewest facilities necessary to capture the market share that you specify._

    <details>
    <summary><span class="font-sm text-color-link">Expand to learn more</span></summary>

    The market share problem types require the most data because, along with knowing your own facilities' weight, you also need to know that of your competitors' facilities. The same types of facilities that use the Maximize Attendance problem type can also use market share problem types, given that they have comprehensive information that includes competitor data.

    Large discount stores typically use the Target Market Share problem type when they want to know how much expansion would be required to reach a certain level of the market share or see what strategy would be needed just to maintain their current market share, given the introduction of new competing facilities. The results often represent what stores would like to do if budgets weren't a concern. In other cases in which budget is a concern, stores revert to the Maximize Market Share problem and simply capture as much of the market share as possible with a limited number of facilities.

    The following list describes how the target market share problem handles demand:

    -   The total market share, which is used in calculating the captured market share, is the sum of the weight of all valid demand points.
    -   A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated.
    -   A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility.
    -   A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to them; furthermore, the weight is split among the facilities proportionally to the facilities' attractiveness (facility weight) and inversely proportional to the distance between the facility and demand point. Given equal facility weights, this means more demand weight is assigned to near facilities than far facilities.
