Specify whether facilities will be returned by the service. 

-   `true`—The facilities used as input will be returned as part of the `facilities` property in the JSON response.
-   `false`—The facilities are not returned. 

If you specified the `facilities` parameter value using a REST query request to any ArcGIS Server feature, map, or geoprocessing service that returns a JSON feature set, you can set the `returnFacilities` parameter to `true` so you can draw the facility locations in the application. You can also set the `returnFacilities` property to `true` to determine whether the facilities were successfully located on the street network or had other errors by reviewing the `Status` property in the JSON response.
