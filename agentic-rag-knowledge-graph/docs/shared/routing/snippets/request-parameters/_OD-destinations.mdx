Specify the locations that function as ending points in generating the paths from origins.

When specifying the destinations, you can set attributes for each as follows:

<details>
 <summary><span class="font-sm text-color-link">Show attributes for destinations</span></summary>

 #### Attributes for destinations

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Name</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 500)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The name of the destination. The name can be a unique identifier for the destination. 
    
    <If c="requestType == 'job'">
    The name is included in the output lines (as the `DestinationName` field) and in the output origins (as the `Name` field) and can be used to join additional information from the analysis outputs to the attributes of your destinations.
    </If>

    <If c="requestType == 'direct'">
    If `outputType` is `esriNAODOutputStraightLines` or `esriNAODOutputNoLines`, the name is included in the output lines `Name` field (the output lines name will be origin name â€“ destination name). The name is also included in the output destinations as the `Name` field.
    </If>

    If the name is not specified, a unique name prefixed with Location is automatically generated.

<If c="requestType=='direct'">
-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ObjectID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p> 

    The object ID of the destination.
    
    `ObjectID` is a unique identifier for the destination. If the `outputType` value is `esriNAODOutputStraightLines` or `esriNAODOutputNoLines`, the `ObjectID` value is included in the output lines (as the `DestinationID` field). If `outputType` is `esriNAODOutputSparseMatrix`, the `ObjectID` value is included in the output matrix. The `ObjectID` value is also included in the output destinations (as the `ObjectID` field) and can be used to join additional information from analysis outputs to the attribute of the destinations. If the `ObjectID` value is not specified, a unique ID is automatically generated in the output.

    Specify the direction a vehicle can arrive at a destination. The field value is specified as one of the following integers:

    - `0`: Either side of vehicle. The vehicle can arrive at a destination in either direction. U-turns are allowed. You should choose this setting if your vehicle can make a U-turn at the destination or if it can pull into a driveway or parking lot and turn around.
    - `1`: Right side of vehicle. When the vehicle arrive at a destination, the curb must be on the right side of the vehicle. A U-turn is prohibited.
    - `2`: Left side of vehicle. When the vehicle arrive at a destination, the curb must be on the left side of the vehicle. A U-turn is prohibited.
    - `3`: No U-turn. When the vehicle arrives at a destination, the curb can be on either side of the vehicle; however, the vehicle must depart without turning around. [Learn more about U-turn policies](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/networks/u-turn-policies.htm)

    The vehicle can arrive at a destination in either direction, so a U-turn is allowed at the destination. This setting can be chosen if it is possible and desirable for a vehicle to turn around at the destination. This decision may depend on the width of the road and the amount of traffic or whether the location has a parking lot where vehicles can pull in and turn around.

    The `CurbApproach` attribute is designed to work with both types of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a destination on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards is your decision to arrive at a destination from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at a destination and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the destination, choose 1 (Right side of vehicle) in the United States and 2 (Left side of vehicle) in the United Kingdom.
