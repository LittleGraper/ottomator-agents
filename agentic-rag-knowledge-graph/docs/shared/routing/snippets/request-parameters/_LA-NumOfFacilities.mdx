Specify the number of facilities the task should choose. 

The facilities with a `FacilityType` attribute value of 1 (Required) are always chosen first. Any excess facilities to choose are picked from candidate facilities, which have a `FacilityType` attribute value of 2. If the number of facilities to find is less than the number of required facilities, an error occurs.

The `number_of_facilities_to_find` parameter is ignored for the Minimize Facilities and Target Market Share problem types since the task determines the minimum number of facilities needed to meet the objectives.
