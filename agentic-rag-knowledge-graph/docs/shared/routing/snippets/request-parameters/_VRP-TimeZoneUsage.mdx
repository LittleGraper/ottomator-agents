**Allowed values:** `GEO_LOCAL`, `UTC`

Specify the time zone for the input date-time fields. This parameter specifies the time zone for the following fields: `TimeWindowStart1`, `TimeWindowEnd1`, `TimeWindowStart2`, `TimeWindowEnd2`, `InboundArriveTime`, and `OutboundDepartTime` on `orders`; `TimeWindowStart1`, `TimeWindowEnd1`, `TimeWindowStart2`, and `TimeWindowEnd2` on `depots`; `EarliestStartTime`  and `LatestStartTime` on `routes`; and `TimeWindowStart` and `TimeWindowEnd` on `breaks` . 

- `GEO_LOCAL`—The date-time values associated with the orders or depots are in the time zone in which the orders and depots are located. For routes, the date-time values are based on the time zone in which the starting depot for the route is located. If a route does not have a starting depot, all orders and depots across all the routes must be in a single time zone. For breaks, the date-time values are based on the time zone of the routes. For example, if your depot is located in an area that follows eastern standard time and has the first time window values (specified as `TimeWindowStart1` and `TimeWindowEnd1`) of 8 AM and 5 PM, the time window values will be treated as 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. in eastern standard time.
- `UTC`—The date-time values associated with the orders or depots are in the in coordinated universal time (UTC) and are not based on the time zone in which the orders or depots are located. For example, if your depot is located in an area that follows eastern standard time and has the first time window values (specified as `TimeWindowStart1` and `TimeWindowEnd1`) of 8 AM and 5 PM, the time window values will be treated as 3:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. in eastern standard time.
