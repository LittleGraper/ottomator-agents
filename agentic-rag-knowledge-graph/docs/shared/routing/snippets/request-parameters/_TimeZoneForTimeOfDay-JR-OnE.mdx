**Allowed values:** `Geographically Local`, `UTC`

Specify the time zone or zones of the `time_Of_day` parameter. 


-   `Geographically Local`—The `time_Of_day` value refers to the time zone or zones in which the input points are located. This option causes the analysis to have rolling start times across time zones.

    Setting `time_of_day` to 9:00 a.m., January 4, 1990 (631443600000 milliseconds); `time_zone_for_time_Of_Day` to `Geographically Local`; and submitting a valid request causes the drive times for points in the eastern time zone to start at 9:00 a.m. eastern Time and 9:00 a.m. central time for points in the central time zone. (The start times are offset by an hour in real or UTC time.)
