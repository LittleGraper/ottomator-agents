Specify the maximum travel time or distance allowed between a demand point and the facility to which it is allocated. If a demand point is outside the cutoff of a facility, it cannot be allocated to that facility.

The default value of `None` means travel isn't limited. The units for this parameter are the same as those specified by the `measurement_units` parameter. The travel time or distance is measured by the shortest path along roads. This property might be used to model the maximum distance that people are willing to travel to visit stores or the maximum time that is permitted for a fire department to reach anyone in the community.

Note that demand points have `TimeCutoff` and `DistanceCutoff` attributes, which, if set accordingly, override the `default_measurement_cutoff` parameter. You may find that people in rural areas are willing to travel up to 10 miles to reach a facility while urbanites are only willing to travel up to two miles. Assuming `measurement_units` is set to `miles`, you can model this behavior by setting the `default_measurement_cutoff` to `10` and the `DistanceCutoff` attribute value of the demand points in urban areas to `2`.
