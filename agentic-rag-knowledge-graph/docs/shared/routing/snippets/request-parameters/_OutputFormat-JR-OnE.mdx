**Allowed values:** `Feature Set`, `JSON File`, `GeoJSON File`

Specify the format in which the output features will be returned.

-   `Feature Set`—The output features will be returned as feature classes and tables. 

-   `JSON File`—The output features will be returned as a compressed file containing the JSON representation of the outputs. When this option is specified, the output is a single file (with a `.zip` extension) that contains one or more JSON files (with a `.json` extension) for each of the outputs created by the service.

-   `GeoJSON File`—The output features will be returned as a compressed file containing the GeoJSON representation of the outputs. When this option is specified, the output is a single file (with a `.zip` extension) that contains one or more GeoJSON files (with a `.geojson` extension) for each of the outputs created by the service.

<Note type="Tip">

 Specifying file based output format, such as a `JSON File`, is useful when you are calling the service using the REST endpoint of the service. In such cases, returning all the outputs as a single file allows you to download large results that can be generated by the service. For example, if you are working with the `GenerateOriginDestinationCostMatrix` service and you generate a travel matrix with 1,000,000 records, returning such a large output as a `Feature Set` can cause the service to fail since the service will try to send the entire output in a single attempt. With a file-based output, the service sends the output in multiple chunks, reducing the possibility of timeouts.
