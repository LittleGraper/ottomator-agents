Specify whether the service areas from different facilities can overlap each other.

-   `true`—The service areas can overlap each other.
-   `false`—A service area from one facility cannot overlap service areas from other facilities. With this option, the area inside any given service area is closer to the corresponding facility than any other facility. 

This parameter will produce the same result with either value when only one facility is specified.
