Specify whether the service will create the shapes for the output assigned and unassigned stops.

-   `true`—The output assigned and unassigned stops are created as point features. This can be useful to visualize which stops are assigned to routes and which stops could not be assigned to any routes.
-   `false`—The output assigned and unassigned stops are created as tables and will not have shapes. Use this option only if your application does not have a need to visualize the output stops and can work with just the attributes of the stops.
