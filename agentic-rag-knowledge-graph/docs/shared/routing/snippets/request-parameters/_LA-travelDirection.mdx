**Allowed values:** `Facility to Demand`, `Demand to Facility`

Specify whether to measure travel times or distances from facilities to demand points or from demand points to facilities. 

-   `Facility to Demand`—Direction of travel is from facilities to demand points.
-   `Demand to Facility`—Direction of travel is from demand points to facilities.

Travel times and distances may change based on direction of travel. If you're going from point A to point B, you may encounter less traffic or have a shorter path, due to one-way streets and turn restrictions, than if you were traveling in the opposite direction. For instance, going from point A to point B may only take 10 minutes, but going the other direction may take 15 minutes. These differing measurements may affect whether demand points can be assigned to certain facilities because of cutoffs or, in problem types in which demand is apportioned, affect how much demand is captured.

Fire departments commonly measure from facilities to demand points since they are concerned with the time it takes to travel from the fire station to the location of the emergency. A retail store is more concerned with the time it takes shoppers to reach the store; therefore, stores commonly measure from demand points to facilities.

The `travel_direction` parameter also determines the meaning of any start time that is provided. See the [`time_of_day`](#time_of_day) parameter for more information.
