Specify whether the service will return empty results instead of the error property when the request fails.

-   `true`—The JSON response doesn't contain the error property when the request fails. All errors are returned in the messages property. The response JSON may contain an empty feature set or empty result for the properties you requested.
-   `false`—The JSON response only contains the error property when the request fails.

Typically when a request fails, the service will return a JSON response that contains the error property. In some cases, you might want to set `returnEmptyResults` to `true` so it always returns properties you requested instead of returning an error response to help handle the response in a more consistent way. 

Even if the request fails, when you set `returnEmptyResults= true` and `returnStops= true`, you can return stops to investigate why some of them failed to locate.
