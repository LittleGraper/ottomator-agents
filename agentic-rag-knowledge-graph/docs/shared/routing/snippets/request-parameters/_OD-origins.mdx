Specify the locations that function as starting points in generating the paths to destinations.

When specifying the origins, you can set attributes for each as follows:

<details>
 <summary><span class="font-sm text-color-link">Show attributes for origins</span></summary>

 #### Attributes for origins

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Name</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 500)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The name of the origin. The name can be a unique identifier for the origin. 
    
    <If c="requestType == 'job'">
    The name is included in the output lines (as the `OriginName` field) and in the output origins (as the `Name` field) and can be used to join additional information from the analysis outputs to the attributes of your origins.
    </If>

    <If c="requestType == 'direct'">
    If `outputType` is `esriNAODOutputStraightLines` or `esriNAODOutputNoLines`, the name is included in the output lines `Name` field (the output lines name will be origin name â€“ destination name). The name is also included in the output origins as the `Name` field.
    </If>

    If the name is not specified, a unique name prefixed with Location is automatically generated.

<If c="requestType=='direct'">
-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ObjectID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p> 

    The object ID of the origin.
    
    `ObjectID` is a unique identifier for the origin. If the `outputType` value is `esriNAODOutputStraightLines` or `esriNAODOutputNoLines`, the `ObjectID` value is included in the output lines (as the `OriginID` field). If `outputType` is `esriNAODOutputSparseMatrix`, the `ObjectID` value is included in the output matrix. The `ObjectID` value is also included in the output origins (as the `ObjectID` field) and can be used to join additional information from analysis outputs to the attribute of the origins. If the `ObjectID` value is not specified, a unique ID is automatically generated in the output. 
</If>

<If c="requestType=='direct' && publication =='services-reference/enterprise'">
<NetworkLocationFields />
</If>

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">TargetDestinationCount</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span></p>

    The maximum number of destinations to find for the origin.

    <If c="requestType == 'job'">
    If a value is not specified, the value from the `number_of_destinations_to_find` parameter is used.
    </If>

    <If c="requestType == 'direct'">
    If a value is not specified, the value from the `defaultTargetDestinationCount` parameter is used.
    </If>

    This field allows you to specify a different number of destinations to find for each origin. For example, using this field, you can find the three closest destinations from one origin and the two closest destinations from another origin.

<If c="requestType=='job'">

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Cutoff</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p> 

    The impedance value at which to stop searching for destinations from a given origin. 
    
    This attribute allows you to specify a different cutoff value for each destination. For example, using this attribute, you can specify to search for destinations within five minutes of travel time from one origin and to search for destinations within eight minutes of travel time from another origin.

    The units of the cutoff are the same as the units of your impedance attribute. If a value is not specified, the value from the [`cutoff`](#cutoff) parameter is used.
</If>

<If c="requestType=='direct'">
-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Cutoff_[Impedance]</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p> 

    If you want to stop searching for destinations once the search has exceeded a certain impedance value, specify a `Cutoff_[Impedance]` field value for your origin.

    This is the impedance attribute name in the analysis, or the impedance name of the travel mode if you specify a travel mode. This attribute allows you to specify a different cutoff value for each destination.

    For example, using this attribute, you can specify to search for destinations within five minutes of travel time from one origin and to search for destinations within eight minutes of travel time from another origin.

    The units of the cutoff are the same as the units of the impedance attribute. If a value is not specified, the [`defaultCutoff`](#defaultCutoff) parameter value is used.
</If>

<If c="requestType=='direct' && publication == 'rest/routing'">
If you have multiple network cost attributes, you'll see multiple `Cutoff_[Impedance]` fields. Consequently, you may have more than one time- or distance-based `Cutoff_[Impedance]` field. The field values you provide are only referenced if the cost attribute referred to in the field name is used in the analysis as impedance attribute; it is not used if the attribute is used in the analysis as accumulate attribute.
</If>

    Allowed values: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`

    Specify the direction a vehicle can depart from the origin. The field value is specified as one of the following integers:

    - `0`: Either side of vehicle. The vehicle can depart the origin in either direction. U-turns are allowed. You should choose this setting if your vehicle can make a U-turn at the origin or if it can pull into a driveway or parking lot and turn around.
    - `1`: Right side of vehicle. When the vehicle departs the origin, the curb must be on the right side of the vehicle. A U-turn is prohibited.
    - `2`: Left side of vehicle. When the vehicle departs the origin, the curb must be on the left side of the vehicle. A U-turn is prohibited.
    - `3`: No U-turn. When the vehicle departs the origin, the curb can be on either side of the vehicle; however, the vehicle must depart without turning around. [Learn more about U-turn policies](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/networks/u-turn-policies.htm)

    The vehicle can depart the origin in either direction, so a U-turn is allowed at the origin. This setting can be chosen if it is possible and desirable for a vehicle to turn around at the origin. This decision may depend on the width of the road and the amount of traffic or whether the location has a parking lot where vehicles can pull in and turn around.

    The `CurbApproach` attribute is designed to work with both types of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider an origin on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards is your decision to depart an origin from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to depart at an origin and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the facility, choose 1 (Right side of vehicle) in the United States and 2 (Left side of vehicle) in the United Kingdom.
