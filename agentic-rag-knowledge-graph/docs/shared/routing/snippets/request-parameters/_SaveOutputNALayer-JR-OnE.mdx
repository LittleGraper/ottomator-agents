Specify whether the service will save the analysis settings as a network analysis layer file.

You cannot work directly with this file even when you open the file in an ArcGIS Desktop application such as ArcGIS Pro. It is meant to be sent to [Esri Technical Support](https://support.esri.com/en-us/contact) to diagnose the quality of results returned from the service.

-   `true`—The network analysis layer file will be saved. The file can be downloaded from the URL provided as part of the [`output_network_analysis_layer_package`](#output_network_analysis_layer_package) parameter.

-   `false`—The network analysis layer file will not be saved.
