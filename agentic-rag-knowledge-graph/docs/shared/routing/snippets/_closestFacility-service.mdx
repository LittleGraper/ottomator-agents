<MoreInfo>

Finding the closest hospital to an accident, the closest police cars to a crime scene, and the closest store to a customer's address are examples of problems that can be solved using the Closest facility service. When finding the closest facilities, you can specify how many to find and whether the direction of travel is toward or away from them. Once you've found the closest facilities, you can display the best route to or from them and include the travel time, travel distance, and driving directions to each facility. 

The service can use current traffic conditions when determining the best routes. You can also specify an impedance cutoff beyond which the service will not search for a facility. For instance, you can set up a Closest facility service to search for hospitals within a 15-minute drive time of the site of an accident. Any hospitals that take longer than 15 minutes to reach will not be included in the results. The hospitals are referred to as facilities, and the accident is referred to as an incident. The service allows you to perform multiple closest facility analyses simultaneously. This means you can have multiple incidents and find the closest facility or facilities to each incident.

The `solve` operation is performed on a [network layer resource](rest/services-reference/enterprise/network-layer). The `solve` operation is supported on a network layer with a `layerType` value of `esriNAServerRouteLayer`.

<Note type={"note"}>

The service works in all the supported countries as listed in the [data coverage page](/network-coverage). One or more countries are grouped together to form an analysis region. The service can determine the best region to use based on the location of the inputs; otherwise, you can use a parameter to specify a region. The service does not support requests that span more than one region. Consequently, the service will only generate results for inputs that fall within one region.
