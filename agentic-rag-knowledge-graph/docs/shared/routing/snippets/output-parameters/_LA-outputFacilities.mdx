-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Name</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 500)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The name of the facility. The values for this field are copied from the `Name` field on the input facilities.

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">FacilityOID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The `ObjectID` value of the corresponding input facility feature. This field is often used to join information from the input facilities.

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">FacilityType</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">int enum</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The best facilities, or those that are chosen in the analysis, are indicated in this field. The facility types are as follows:

    -   `0`:Candidate—The service didn't choose the candidate facility to be part of the solution.
    -   `1`:Required—Prior to submitting the analysis, the facility was designated as required; therefore, it is part of the solution regardless of how much demand it captured.
    -   `2`:Competitor—The facility represents the rivals and will remove demand from the problem. Competitor facilities are specific to the Maximize Market Share and Target Market Share problem types; they are ignored in other problem types.
    -   `3`:Chosen—These are the chosen facilities; that is, they are candidate facilities that capture the most demand.

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Weight</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The relative weighting of the facility, which is used to rate the attractiveness, desirability, or bias of one facility compared to another. The values for this field are copied from the `Weight` field on the input facilities. 

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Capacity</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The amount of weighted demand the facility is capable of supplying. The values for this field are copied from the Capacity field on the input facilities.

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">DemandCount</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    A count of demand points allocated to the facility. A value other than zero means the facility was part of the solution, either as a required, competitor, or chosen facility.
    
-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">DemandWeight</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The sum of the effective weight from all demand points that were allocated to the facility. The value is the sum of all the weight values from the demand points that were allocated to the facility. In the case of the Maximize Attendance and Market Share problem types, the value is an apportioned sum of the Weight field values, since these problem types allow demand to decay with distance or be split among many facilities.

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Total_Minutes</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The sum of travel time in minutes between the facility and each of the demand points that were allocated to the facility.

    This field is included only if the travel mode set for the analysis has an impedance attribute that is time based. 

    <Note type={"note"}>
    An additional field, Total_[TimeUnits] , is included if the `measurement_units` parameter is time based and its value is not set to `Minutes`. The field values are in the units specified by the `measurement_units` parameter. 
    </Note>

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">TotalWeighted_Minutes</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    This field stores the cumulative weighted cost in minutes for a facility. The weighted cost for a demand point is its weight multiplied by the least-cost path between the facility and the demand point. The weighted cost for a facility is the sum of all the weighted costs of demand points that are allocated to the facility.

    For example, if a demand point with a weight of 2 is allocated to a facility 10 minutes away, the `TotalWeighted_Minutes` value is 20 (2 x 10). If another demand point with a weight of 3 is allocated to the same facility and is 5 minutes away, the `TotalWeighted_Minutes` value increases to 35 (3 x 5 + 20).

    This field is included only if the travel mode set for the analysis has an impedance attribute that is time based.

    <Note type={"note"}>
    An additional field, `TotalWeighted_[TimeUnits]`, is included if the `measurement_units` parameter is time based and its value is not set to `Minutes`. The field values are in the units specified by the `measurement_units` parameter.
    </Note>

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Total_Miles</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The sum of travel distance in miles between the facility and each of the demand points that were allocated to the facility.

    This field is included only if the travel mode set for the analysis has an impedance attribute that is distance based.

    <Note type={"note"}>
    An additional field, `Total_[DistanceUnits]`, is included if the `measurement_units` parameter is distance based and its value is not set to `Miles` or `Kilometers`. The field values are in the units specified by the `measurement_units` parameter.
    </Note>

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">TotalWeighted_Miles</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    This field stores the cumulative weighted cost in miles for a facility. The weighted cost for a demand point is its weight multiplied by the least-cost path between the facility and the demand point. The weighted cost for a facility is the sum of all the weighted costs of demand points that are allocated to the facility.

    For example, if a demand point with a weight of 2 is allocated to a facility 10 miles away, the `TotalWeighted_Miles` value is 20 (2 x 10). If another demand point with a weight of 3 is allocated to the same facility and is 5 miles away, the `TotalWeighted_Miles` value increases to 35 (3 x 5 + 20)

    This field is included only if the travel mode set for the analysis has an impedance attribute that is distance based. 

    <Note type={"note"}>
    An additional field, `TotalWeighted_[DistanceUnits]`, is included if the [`measurement_units`](#measurement_units) parameter is distance based and its value is not set to `Miles` or `Kilometers`. The field values are in the units specified by the `measurement_units` parameter.

    This field is analogous to the `Total_Miles` field, except values are in kilometers instead of miles.

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Total_Other</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    A sum of travel cost in unknown units between the facility and each of the demand points that were allocated to the facility.

    This field is included only if the travel mode set for the analysis has an impedance attribute that is neither time based nor distance based.

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">TotalWeighted_Other</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    This field stores the cumulative weighted cost in unknown units for a facility. The weighted cost for a demand point is its weight multiplied by the least-cost path between the facility and the demand point. The weighted cost for a facility is the sum of all the weighted costs of demand points that are allocated to the facility.

    This field is included only if the travel mode set for the analysis has an impedance attribute that is neither time based nor distance based.
