Stores the resultant service areas as linear features and covers the streets, or network edges, that can be reached within the given time, distance, or other travel-cost cutoff. Lines are a truer representation of a service area than polygons since service area analyses are based on measurements along the network lines.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ObjectID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span></p>

    The system-managed ID field.

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">FacilityID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The unique identifier of the associated facility.

    If you specify `preserveObjectID=false`, the value for this field will be a system-generated ID. If `preserveObjectID=True`, the value for this field will be the ObjectID of your associated input.

- <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">SourceID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

  Each service area line traverses a feature from a network source feature classâ€”a feature class used to create the network dataset on which the service area analysis is performed. This field specifies the unique ID of the source feature class the traversed feature is a part of.

- <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">SourceOID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

  The ObjectID value of the traversed street feature. Summarizing the values for this field can provide useful information such as the number of times a particular street feature is included from the facilities. 

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">FromPosition</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    Specifies where along the underlying source feature the service area line begins.

    A value of 0 (zero) indicates that the service area line begins at the from point of the underlying source feature.
    A value of 1 indicates that the service area line begins at the to point of the underlying source feature.
    A value between 0 and 1 indicates that the line begins at a point along the underlying source feature; for example, a value of 0.25 means the line begins 25 percent along the digitized direction of the underlying source feature.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ToPosition</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    Specifies where along the underlying source feature the service area line ends.

    A value of 0 (zero) indicates that the service area line ends at the from point of the underlying source feature.
    A value of 1 indicates that the service area line ends at the to point of the underlying source feature.
    A value between 0 and 1 indicates that the line ends at a point along the underlying source feature; for example, a value of 0.25 means the line ends 25 percent along the digitized direction of the underlying source feature.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">FromCumul_[Cost]</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    This field contains the cumulative cost of the path from the facility to the beginning of the line feature. For instance, `FromCumul_Miles`, where `Miles` is the travel cost. The cost of the adjacent junction at the beginning of the line is included in this value. This field is generated for the cost attribute and any accumulation attributes.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ToCumul_[Cost]</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    This field contains the cumulative cost of the path from the facility to the end of the line feature. For instance, `ToCumul_Miles`, where `Miles` is the travel cost. The cost of the adjacent junction at the end of the line is excluded from this value. This field is generated for the cost attribute and any accumulation attributes.
