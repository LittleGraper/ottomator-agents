Provides access to the attributes of the stops that are visited by the routes as well as stops that cannot be reached by any of the routes.

The following table list the fields returned for output stops. In addition to these fields, the parameter also includes all the fields from the input feature class used as stops for the analysis.

You can use the attributes from this parameter, such as the `Status` field, to determine why a stop was not assigned to any routes.
