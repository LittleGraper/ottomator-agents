Provides access to polygon features that represent areas that can be reached from the input locations with a given travel time, travel distance, or travel cost.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ObjectID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span></p>

    The system-managed ID field.

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">FacilityID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The unique identifier of the associated facility.

    If you specify `preserveObjectID=false`, the value for this field will be a system-generated ID. If `preserveObjectID=True`, the value for this field will be the ObjectID of your associated input.

    Multiple facilities can be associated with one service area when `mergeSimilarPolygonRanges` is set to `true`. `FacilityID` field values are set to null when service areas are merged. 
    
-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Name</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 500)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The name of the service area. It is based on the name of the associated facility and the cutoffs; for example, `Store1: 0.0 – 5.0` represents a service area that covers all traversable streets within five minutes of a facility named `Store1` .

    The break values are returned without the name of the facility, for example, `0.0 – 5.0`, when `mergeSimilarPolygonRanges` is set to `true` .

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">FromBreak</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    The lower bound of the service area's impedance cutoff range. The unit for this field is based on the unit of the impedance attribute set for the analysis.

    If the impedance attribute is time-based, the value is in the units specified by the `timeUnits` property. If the impedance attribute is distance-based, the value is in the units specified by the `distanceUnits` property. The value is in unknown units if the impedance attribute is neither time-based nor distance-based.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ToBreak</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    The upper bound of the service area's impedance cutoff range. The value is in the same units as the `FromBreak` field values.
