    The `ObjectID` value of the traversed street feature. Summarizing the values for this field can provide useful information such as the number of times a particular street feature is included in all the routes.

    The ID representing the edge that comprises the street feature. Since there can be more than one edge per street feature, the `SourceOID` field can be used to uniquely identify the traversed street feature, and the `RouteEdgeID` field can be used to uniquely identify the edge within the traversed street feature.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">FromPosition</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    Specifies where the output `RouteEdges` feature begins in reference to the digitized direction of the underlying street feature.

    -   0 (zero) indicates that the line begins at the from point of the underlying street feature.
    -   1 indicates that the line begins at the to point of the street feature.
    -   A value between 0 and 1 indicates that the line begins at a point along the underlying street feature; for example, a value of 0.25 means the line begins 25 percent along the digitized direction of the underlying street feature.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ToPosition</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    Specifies where the output `RouteEdges` feature ends in reference to the digitized direction of the underlying street feature.

    -   0 indicates that the line ends at the from point of the underlying street feature.
    -   1 indicates that the line ends at the to point of the street feature.
    -   A value between 0 and 1 indicates that the line ends at a point along the underlying street feature; for example, a value of 0.25 means the line ends 25 percent along the digitized direction of the underlying street feature.

<If c="requestType == 'job' && publication == 'rest/online'">

    Uniquely identifies the route that traversed the edge.

    The `RouteID` value corresponds to an `ObjectID` value from the output routes.

    The travel time in minutes of the traversed portion of the underlying street feature.

    <Note type={"note"}>
    An additional field, `Attr_[TimeUnits]`, is included if the `measurement_units` parameter is time-based and its value is not set to `Minutes`. The field values are in the units specified by the `measurement_units` parameter.
    </Note>

    The length in miles of the traversed portion of the underlying street feature.

    <Note type={"note"}>
    An additional field, `Attr_[DistanceUnits]`, is included if the `measurement_units` parameter is distance-based and its value is not `Miles` or `Kilometers`. The field values are in the units specified by the `measurement_units` parameter.
    </Note>

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Attr_Kilometers</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The length in kilometers of the traversed portion of the underlying street feature.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Attr_Other</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The travel cost of the traversed portion of the underlying street feature. This field is included only when the travel mode used for the analysis has an impedance attribute that is neither time-based nor distance-based. The value is in unknown units.

    <Note type={"note"}>
    Additional fields, `Attr_[AccumulateAttributeName]`, are included for each cost attribute that is neither time-based nor distance-based and accumulated during the analysis.
    </Note>

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Cumul_Minutes</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The travel time in minutes of the route from its origin to the end of the traversed portion of this underlying street feature.

    <Note type="note" block>

    -   An additional field, `Cumul_[TimeUnits]`, is included if the `measurement_units` parameter is time-based and its value is not set to `Minutes`. The field values are in the units specified by the `measurement_units` parameter.
    -   Additional fields, `Cumul_[AccumulateAttributeName]`, are included for each time-based cost attribute that is accumulated during the analysis. The values are in the time units used for the analysis.

    </Note>

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Cumul_Miles</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The length in miles of the route from its origin to the end of the traversed portion of this underlying street feature. 

    <Note type="note" block>

    -   An additional field, `Cumul_[DistanceUnits]`, is included if the `measurement_units` parameter is distance-based and its value is not `Miles` or `Kilometers`. The field values are in the units specified by the `measurement_units` parameter.
    -   Additional fields, `Cumul_[AccumulateAttributeName]`, are included for each distance-based cost attribute that is accumulated during the analysis. The values are in the distance units used for the analysis.

    </Note>

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Cumul_Kilometers</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The length in kilometers of the route from its origin to the end of the traversed portion of this underlying street feature.

    The travel cost of the route from its origin to the end of the traversed portion of this underlying street feature. This field is included only when the travel mode used for the analysis has an impedance attribute that is neither time-based nor distance-based. The value is in unknown units.

    <Note type={"note"}>

    Additional fields, `Cumul_[AccumulateAttributeName]`, are included for each cost attribute that is neither time-based nor distance-based and accumulated during the analysis.

    Specifies whether the traversed edge used the soft restriction attribute referred to in this field's name.

    0—The traversed edge didn't use the soft restriction.
    1—The traversed edge used the soft restriction.

    For example, if the analysis was performed using the soft restriction called Avoid Toll Roads, a field called `Attr_Avoid_Toll_Roads` is created for this soft restriction. A value of `1` for this field would represent the toll roads in the route.
