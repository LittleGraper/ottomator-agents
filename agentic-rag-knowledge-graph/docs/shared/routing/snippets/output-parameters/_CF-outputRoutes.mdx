The [`route_shape`](#route_shape) and [`route_line_simplification_tolerance`](#route_line_simplification_tolerance) parameters influence the shape of the output routes.

The route geometries are returned in the spatial reference specified as the [`context`](#context) parameter.

    The facility name is first if the value for the `travel_direction` parameter is set to `Facility to Incident`. For example, `Facility 5 - Incident 3` indicates that the route travels from Facility 5 to Incident 3.

    If `Incident to Facility` is specified as the value for the `travel_direction` parameter, the incident name is first, for example, `Incident 3 — Facility 5`.

    <If c="requestType == 'direct'">
    The facility name is first if the value for the `travelDirection` property on the analysis object is set to `esriNATravelDirectionFromFacility`. For example, Facility 5 - Incident 3 indicates that the route travels from Facility 5 to Incident 3.

    If `esriNATravelDirectionToFacility` is specified as the value for the `travelDirection` property, the incident name is first, for example, Incident 3 — Facility 5 .
