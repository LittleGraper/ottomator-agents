Provides access to points that act as temporary restrictions or represent additional time or distance that may be required to travel on the underlying streets.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ObjectID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span></p>

    If you specify `preserveObjectID=false`, the value for this field will be a system-generated ID. If `preserveObjectID=True`, the value for this field will be the `ObjectID` of your associated input.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Name</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 500)</span></p>

    The name of the barrier. 

<NetworkLocationFields />

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">CurbApproach</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">int enum</span><span class="font-bold text-[#6d29cc]">default:0</span></p>

    Allowed values: `0`, `1`, `2`

    The direction of traffic that is affected by the barrier. The field value is specified as one of the following integers:

    - `0`: Either side of vehicle. The barrier affects travel over the edge in both directions.
    - `1`: Right side of vehicle. Vehicles are only affected if the barrier is on their right side during the approach. Vehicles that traverse the same edge but approach the barrier on their left side are not affected by the barrier.
    - `2`: Vehicles are only affected if the barrier is on their left side during the approach. Vehicles that traverse the same edge but approach the barrier on their right side are not affected by the barrier.

<Stats />

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">FullEdge</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">int enum</span></p>

    Allowed values: `0`, `1`

    Point barriers are applied to the edge elements during the analysis. The field value is specified as one of the following integers

    - `0`:False. Permits travel on the edge up to the barrier but not through it.
    - `1`:True. Restricts travel anywhere on the associated edge.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">BarrierType</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">int enum</span></p>

    Allowed values: `0`, `2`

    Specify whether the point barrier restricts travel completely or adds time or distance when it is crossed. The value for this attribute is specified as one of the following integers:

    - `0`:Restriction. Prohibits travel through the barrier. The barrier is referred to as a restriction point barrier since it acts as a restriction.
    - `2`:Added Cost. Traveling through the barrier increases the travel time or distance by the amount specified in the `Attr_[Cost]` attribute. 

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Attr_[Cost]</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#6d29cc]">default:0</span></p>

    This attribute is specific to added-cost barriers and is limited to values that are greater than or equal to zero. It indicates how much cost is added when the barrier is traversed.
