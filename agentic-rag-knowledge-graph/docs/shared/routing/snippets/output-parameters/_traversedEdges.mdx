-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ObjectID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span></p>

    The system-managed ID field.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">SourceID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The numeric identifier of the feature class the traversal element is referencing.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">SourceOID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The object ID of the traversed source feature. 

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">EID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer (non-negative)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The element ID (EID) of the traversed network edge. An `EID` uniquely describes a network element. The EID of a network element is independent of the object ID of the feature. One feature can be stored as many different elements in the network.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">FromPosition</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    Specifies where the output `RouteEdges` feature begins in reference to the digitized direction of the underlying street feature.

    -   0 (zero) indicates that the line begins at the from point of the underlying street feature.
    -   1 indicates that the line begins at the to point of the street feature.
    -   A value between 0 and 1 indicates that the line begins at a point along the underlying street feature; for example, a value of 0.25 means the line begins 25 percent along the digitized direction of the underlying street feature.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ToPosition</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    Specifies where the output `RouteEdges` feature ends in reference to the digitized direction of the underlying street feature.

    -   0 indicates that the line ends at the from point of the underlying street feature.
    -   1 indicates that the line ends at the to point of the street feature.
    -   A value between 0 and 1 indicates that the line ends at a point along the underlying street feature; for example, a value of 0.25 means the line ends 25 percent along the digitized direction of the underlying street feature.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">FromJunctionID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The reference to the object ID of the junction in the `traversedJunctions` record set that is coincident with the start of the edge.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">ToJunctionID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The reference to the object ID of the junction in the `traversedJunctions` record set that is coincident with the end of the edge.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">RouteID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The object ID of the route in the output `routes` record set.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Attr_[Cost]</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    The cost of the underlying edge. The units of this field are the same as the units of the cost attribute referred to in the field name.

    This field will be populated if the `[Cost]` part of this field is used as an impedance attribute or accumulated attributes.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Cumul_[Cost]</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number (non-negative)</span></p>

    The cumulative cost of the underlying network elements from the beginning of the route to the end of the edge represented by the line feature.

    The units of this field are the same as the units of the cost attribute referred to in the field name.

    This field will be populated if the `[Cost]` part of this field is used as an impedance attribute or accumulated attributes.

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Attr_[Restriction]</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">int enum</span></p>

    Allowed values: `0`, `1`

    Indicates whether the traversed edge used the restriction attribute referred to in this field's name.

    -   `0`—The traversed edge didn't use the restriction.
    -   `1`—The traversed edge used the restriction.

    <Note type={"note"}>
    Elements that use prohibit-restrictions are never traversed; however, those that use prefer- or avoid-restrictions can be traversed.
