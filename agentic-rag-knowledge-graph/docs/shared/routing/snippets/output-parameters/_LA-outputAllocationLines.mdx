Provides access to the lines that connect demand points to the facilities to which they are allocated. Such lines are referenced in the documentation as allocation lines.

<details>
 <summary><span class="font-sm text-color-link">Show attributes for output allocation lines</span></summary>

-   <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Name</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">string (length: 500)</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The name of the allocation line that includes the names of the demand point and facility to which the demand point is allocated.

    The name of the allocation line is based on the names of the associated facility and demand point.

    The facility name is first if the `travel_direction` parameter value is set to `Facility To Demand`. For example, Facility 5 - Demand 3 indicates that the route travels from Facility 5 to Demand 3.

    If `Demand To Facility` is specified as the `travel_direction` parameter value, the demand point name is first, for example, Demand 3 â€” Facility 5 .

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">FacilityOID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The `ObjectID` value of the corresponding input facility feature. This field is often used to join information from the facilities to the allocation lines.

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">DemandOID</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The `ObjectID` value of the corresponding input demand point feature. This field is often used to join information from the demand points to the allocation lines.

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Weight</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The weight assigned from the connected demand point to the connected facility.

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Total_Minutes</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">integer</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The travel time in minutes between the facility and the demand point. Although the allocation lines have either straight or null geometries, the cost always refers to travel times as measured on a transportation network, not straight-line distances.

    <Note type="note" block>
    -   An additional field, Total_[TimeUnits], is included if the `measurement_units` parameter is time based and its value is not set to `Minutes`. The field values are in the units specified by the `measurement_units` parameter. 
    -   Additional fields, `Total_[AccumulateAttributeName]_[TimeUnits]`, are included for each time-based cost attribute that is accumulated during the analysis.
    </Note>

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">TotalWeighted_Minutes</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The weighted cost of traveling between the facility and the demand point in minutes. This is the `Total_Minutes` value multiplied by the weight of the demand point allocated to the facility.

    This field is included only if the travel mode set for the analysis has an impedance attribute that is time based.

    <Note type={"note"}>
    An additional field, `TotalWeighted_[TimeUnits]`, is included if the `measurement_units` parameter is time based and its value is not set to `Minutes`. The field values are in the units specified by the `measurement_units` parameter.
    </Note>

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Total_Miles</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The travel distance in miles between the facility and the demand point. Although the allocation lines have either straight or null geometries, the cost always refers to travel distances as measured on a transportation network, not straight-line distances.

    <Note type="note" block>
    -   An additional field, `Total_[DistanceUnits]`, is included if the `measurement_units` parameter is distance based and its value is not set to `Miles` or `Kilometers`. The field values are in the units specified by the `measurement_units` parameter.
    -   Additional fields, `Total_[AccumulateAttributeName]_[DistanceUnits]`, are included for each time-based cost attribute that is accumulated during the analysis.
    </Note>

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Total_Kilometers</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The travel distance in kilometers between the facility and the demand point. Although the allocation lines have either straight or null geometries, the cost always refers to travel distances as measured on a transportation network, not straight-line distances.

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">TotalWeighted_Miles</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The weighted cost of traveling between the facility and the demand point in miles. This is the `Total_Miles` value multiplied by the weight of the demand point allocated to the facility.

    This field is included only if the travel mode set for the analysis has an impedance attribute that is distance based. 

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">TotalWeighted_Kilometers</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The weighted cost of traveling between the facility and the demand point in kilometers. This is the `Total_Kilometers` value multiplied by the weight of the demand point allocated to the facility.

    This field is included only if the travel mode set for the analysis has an impedance attribute that is distance based.

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">Total_Other</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The travel cost in unknown units between the facility and the demand point. Although the allocation lines have either straight or null geometries, the cost always refers to travel cost as measured on a transportation network, not straight-line distances.

    This field is included only when the travel mode used for the analysis has an impedance attribute that is neither time-based nor distance-based.

    <Note type={"note"}>
    Additional fields, `Total_[AccumulateAttributeName]_Other`, are included for each cost attribute that is neither time based nor distance based and accumulated during the analysis.
    </Note>

-  <p class="space-x-2"><span class="font-bold">TotalWeighted_Other</span><span class="font-sm text-color-3">number</span><span class="font-bold text-[#00619b]">nullable</span></p>

    The weighted cost of traveling between the facility and the demand point in unknown units. This is the `Total_Cost` value multiplied by the weight of the demand point allocated to the facility.

    This field is included only if the travel mode set for the analysis has an impedance attribute that is neither time-based nor distance-based.
