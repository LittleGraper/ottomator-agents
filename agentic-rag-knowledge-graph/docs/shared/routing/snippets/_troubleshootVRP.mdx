At times you may encounter certain error messages or unexpected behaviors returned from the fleet routing service. The table below lists some of the common errors that the service may return and how to resolve them.

Errors in Definition

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

At least one order, depot, and route are required for a given fleet routing problem analysis layer to be solved.

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

No order or depot or route is defined. 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Make sure there is at least one order, depot, and route.

Invalid network locations

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The invalid network locations in the Depots and Barriers network analysis classes cannot be ignored. An error message is generated if either of these network analysis classes have invalid network locations. Invalid orders, however, can be ignored.

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

-   During route analysis, some of the stops are not located on the network.
-   A stop is located on an edge that is restricted in both directions.
-   A stop is located on an edge that is blocked at both ends with barriers.
-   A located stop has incorrect time window attributes.

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

-   Verify the inputs locations are valid.
-   If you want to ignore unlocated orders, set the `ignore_invalid_order_locations`  to true.

Relationships in classes

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The attributes in the network analysis classes that act as key fields must have identical values.

[Relationships between network analysis classes in the fleet routing problem](<TODO UNRESOLVED FILE LINK 10.0\cmsfiles\pdf\VRP_NAClasses.pdf>)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The value for the `Name`  attribute in the Depots network analysis class must be identical to the value for the `StartDepotName`  and `EndDepotName`  attributes in the Routes network analysis class. Similarly, the value for the `Name`  attribute in the Routes network analysis class must be identical to the value for the `RouteName`  attribute in the Breaks network analysis class.

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Verify the relationship between classes is correct.

Distance Attribute property

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

The Distance Attribute property of the analysis layer must be specified if you have distance-based constraints.

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

If distance-based constraints, such as `MaxTotalDistance`  and `CostPerUnitDistance` , are specified for routes, the Distance Attribute property of the analysis layer must be specified.

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

If you have distance constraints, make sure the Distance Attribute property of the VRP layer is specified.

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Partial solution

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Not all the orders are routed.

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

If the VRP solver cannot assign all the orders to the routes without violating the given constraints, a partial solution is determined by the solver. The `ViolatedConstraints`  attribute in the Orders and Routes network analysis classes contains information about the constraints that are violated by a particular order or the route.

Learn more about violated constraints for [orders](/vehicle-routing-problem-service#out_unassigned_stops) and [routes](/vehicle-routing-problem-service#out_routes). 

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

-   Check `out_unassigned_stops`  for violated constraints field to understand the reason.
-   Check `out_routes`  for violated constraints field to understand the reason.
