{/*Shared snippet for Travel cost matrix service description */} 

<If c="requestType =='direct'">
The `/solveODCostMatrix` [direct request](/service-requests/#direct-requests) can be used to create an origin-destination (OD) cost matrix from multiple origins to multiple destinations. A travel cost matrix is a table that contains the cost, such as the travel time or travel distance, from every origin to every destination. It also ranks the destinations that each origin connects to in ascending order based on the minimum cost required to travel from that origin to each destination. When generating a travel cost matrix, you can specify the maximum number of destinations to find for each origin and the maximum time or distance to travel when searching for destinations.

<MoreInfo>

The results from the travel cost matrix service often become input for other spatial analyses when the cost to travel on the street network is more appropriate than straight-line cost. For example, predicting the movement of people in a city is better modeled with costs based on street networks, since people tend to travel on roads and pedestrian paths.

The travel time, distance, or both for each origin-destination pair is stored in the output matrix (default) or as part of the attributes of the output lines, which can have no shapes or a straight-line shape. Even though the lines are straight, they always store the travel time and travel distance based on the street network, not based on Euclidean distance.

<Note type={"tip"}>

The Closest facility and Travel cost matrix services perform similar analyses; the main difference is in the output and the computation speed. The Travel cost matrix service generates results faster but cannot return lines that follow the underlying streets or driving directions. It is designed to quickly solve large M x N problems and, as a result, does not internally contain the information required to generate route shapes and driving directions. Alternatively, the Closest facility service can return routes that follow the underlying streets and directions but is slower to run than the Travel cost matrix service. If you need driving directions or true shapes of routes, use the Closest facility service; otherwise, use the Travel cost matrix service to reduce the computation time.

<If c="requestType == 'direct' && publication == 'services-reference/enterprise'">
The `solve` operation is performed on a [network layer resource](DEVSITE/rest/services-reference/enterprise/network-layer/) of type Origin Destination Cost Matrix.
