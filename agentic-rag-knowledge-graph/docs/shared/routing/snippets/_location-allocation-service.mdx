{/*Shared snippet for Location-Allocation service description*/} 

The `/SolveLocationAllocation` [job request](/service-requests/#job-requests) finds a set of facilities that will best serve demand from surrounding areas. As the name suggests, location-allocation is a two-fold problem that simultaneously locates facilities and allocates demand points to the facilities.

Location-allocation can help you answer questions like the following:

-   Given a set of existing fire stations, which site for a new fire station would provide the best response times for the community?
-   If a retail company has to downsize, which stores should it close to maintain the most overall demand?
-   Where should a factory be built to minimize the distance to distribution centers?

In these examples, facilities would represent the fire stations, retail stores, and factories; demand points would represent buildings, customers, and distribution centers.

The objective may be to minimize the overall distance between demand points and facilities, maximize the number of demand points covered within a certain distance of facilities, maximize an apportioned amount of demand that decays with increasing distance from a facility, or maximize the amount of demand captured in an environment of friendly and competing facilities.
