<MoreInfo>

The best route can be the quickest route for a given time of day considering the traffic conditions during that time, or it can be the shortest route that minimizes the travel distance. The Route service can also find the best route that visits each stop during permitted time windows you specify. If you have more than two stops to visit, the best route can be determined for the fixed order of locations you specify. This is called a simple route. Alternatively, the Route service can determine the best sequence in which to visit the locations (the traveling salesman problem). This is called an optimized route.

The `solve` operation is performed on a [network layer resource](rest/services-reference/enterprise/network-layer). The `solve` operation is supported on a network layer with a `layerType` value of `esriNAServerRouteLayer`.
