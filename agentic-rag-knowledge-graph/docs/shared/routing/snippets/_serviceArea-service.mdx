<If c="requestType =='direct'">
The `/solveServiceArea` [direct request](/service-requests/#direct-requests) finds the area that can be reached from the input location within a given travel time or travel distance. A service area is the area that encompasses all streets that can be accessed within a given distance or travel time from one or more locations, referred to as facilities. Service areas are generally used to visualize and measure the accessibility of facilities. 
</If>

<If c="requestType =='job'">
The `/GenerateServiceAreas` [job request](/service-requests#job-requests) finds the area that can be reached from the input location within a given travel time or travel distance. A service area is the area that encompasses all streets that can be accessed within a given distance or travel time from one or more locations, referred to as facilities. Service areas are generally used to visualize and measure the accessibility of facilities.

{/* A service area, also known as an isochrone, is a polygon that represents the distance that can be reached when driving or walking on a street network. This type of analysis is common in real estate search or determining the driving proximity to schools, businesses, or other facilities. */}

For example, a three-minute drive-time polygon around a grocery store can determine which residents can reach the store within three minutes and are thus more likely to shop there. The service can also create multiple concentric service areas around one or more facilities that can show how accessibility changes with an increase in travel time or travel distance. It can be used, for example, to determine how many hospitals are within 5-, 10-, and 15-minute drive times of schools. When creating service areas based on travel times, the service can use traffic data, which can influence the area that can be reached during different times of the day.

<If c="requestType == 'direct' && publication == 'services-reference/enterprise'">
The `solveServiceArea` operation is performed on a [network layer resource](DEVSITE/rest/services-reference/enterprise/network-layer/) of type service area (`layerType` is `esriNAServerServiceArea`).
</If>
