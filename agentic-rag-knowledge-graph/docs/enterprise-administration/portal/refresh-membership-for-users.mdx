## Description

The `refreshMembership` operation iterates over every enterprise group configured in an organization and determines if the user accounts listed in the `users` parameter belong to any of the configured enterprise groups. If there is any change in membership (a user has been added or removed from the enterprise group), the database and the indexes are updated for each user account. While ArcGIS Enterprise automatically refreshes the memberships when a user logs in and during a periodic refresh (configured through the [Update Identity Store](/update-identity-store) operation), this operation allows an administrator to force a refresh.

<Note type={"note"}>

This operation is only supported if portal is configured with enterprise groups. This operation may take a while to complete if there are a substantial number of enterprise users and groups.
