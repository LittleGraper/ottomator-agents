## Description

The `sslCertificates` resource lists all the [certificates](/ssl-certificate-ha) (self-signed and CA-signed) created for a portal machine as well as the certificates currently configured with ArcGIS Enterprise portal. This resource also provides access to operations that can be used to manage SSL certificates in a highly available (multiple machine) environment.

Before you enable SSL on your portal, you need to [generate](/generate-certificate-ha) certificates and get them signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). For your convenience, the portal is capable of generating self-signed certificates that can be used during development or staging. However, it is critical that you obtain CA-signed certificates when standing up a production server.

To get a certificate signed by a CA, you need to [generate a CSR](/generate-csr-ha) (certificate signing request) and then submit it to your CA. The CA will sign your certificate request, which can then be imported into the server by using the [Import Signed Certificate](/import-signed-certificate-ha) operation. The portal securely stores self-signed, CA-signed, and configured certificates inside a key store.
