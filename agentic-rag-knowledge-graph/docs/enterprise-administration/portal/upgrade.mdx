## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

This operation is available only while a portal is being upgraded. It is not available once a successful upgrade has finished.

</Note>

The `upgrade` operation must be invoked first during a Portal for ArcGIS upgrade. Once the new software version has been installed and the setup has completed, this operation becomes available. A successful run of this operation will complete the portal upgrade.

You must input a portal license file when performing an upgrade. Starting at ArcGIS Enterprise 11.1, the license file parameter is required when upgrading a portal from one release series to another (for example, upgrading from 10.9 to 11.1) or when upgrading in the same release series (for example, upgrading from 11.0 to 11.1). In earlier releases, the license file parameter was not required when upgrading to a version in the same release series.

<Note type={"caution"}>

If errors are returned during the `upgrade` operation, you must address the errors before you can continue. For example, if an error regarding an invalid license occurs, you must reauthorize the software using a valid license and retry this operation.

</Note>

If you do not backup your site (`isBackupRequired` is `false`), you must set `isRollbackRequired` to `false`. 

##  Request parameters

<StyledTable headers={"Parameter,Details"}>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      `isBackupRequired` 

    </StyledTableCell>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      Specifies whether the upgrade will backup the content, database, and index folders. The default value is `true`. 

      <Note type={"note"}>

      It is recommended that you set this parameter to `true` to create a backup of directories. When `isBackupRequired` is set to `false`, ensure that other means are in place to create a backup of the content, database, and index folders.

      </Note>

      Values: `true` | `false`

    </StyledTableCell>
  </StyledTableRow>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      `isRollbackRequired`

    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      Specifies whether the content, database, and index folders will revert to the existing content when an upgrade failure occurs. The default value is `true`.

      <Note type={"note"}>

      It is recommended that you set this parameter to `true`. When this parameter is set to `true`, `isBackupRequired` must be also be set to `true` to revert to the backup content, database, and index folders.

      </Note>

    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      Introduced at ArcGIS Enterprise 11.0. This specifies whether the upgrade request will be submitted asynchronously or synchronously. If submitted synchronously, the response is returned once the upgrade process completes successfully or if the request fails. If submitted asynchronously, the `upgrade` operation can be polled by making a request to the `root` resource. The default value is `false` (synchronously).

      Values: `true` | `false`

## JSON Response examples

The subsections below outline the various responses returned when performing an upgrade, depending on whether the job was run synchronously or asynchronously.

### Synchronous upgrades

The following example demonstrates the response returned when the upgrade completes successfully:

```javascript
{
  "status": "success",
  "recheckAfterSecs": 20
}
```

When the upgrade completes successfully, but there are action items that the administrator must perform, a success response with a `warnings` property will be returned:

```javascript
{
  "status": "success with warnings",
  "recheckAfterSecs": 20,
  "warnings": [
    "Failed to update the web server certificate configuration with the certificate in configStore."
  ],
}
```

### Asynchronous upgrades

The following response is returned immediately when the upgrade operation is submitted:

```javascript
{
  "upgradeFromVersion": "10.7.1",
  "upgradeToVersion": "11.0.0",
  "status": "in progress",
  "warnings": [],
  "stages": [
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646337782721,
      "name": "Back up content, database, and index directories",
      "startTime": 1646337782659,
      "state": "not started"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 0,
      "name": "Upgrade portal content",
      "startTime": 0,
      "state": "not started"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 0,
      "name": "Upgrade database",
      "startTime": 0,
      "state": "not started"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 0,
      "name": "Migrate configuration settings",
      "startTime": 0,
      "state": "not started"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 0,
      "name": "Update configuration settings",
      "startTime": 0,
      "state": "not started"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 0,
      "name": "Configure index service",
      "startTime": 0,
      "state": "not started"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 0,
      "name": "Reindex",
      "startTime": 0,
      "state": "not started"
    }
  ],
  "messages": []
}
```

While the upgrade is in process, the `root` resource can be polled to return the upgrade's current status. The sample response below demonstrates this updated response:

```javascript
{
  "upgradeFromVersion": "10.7.1",
  "upgradeToVersion": "11.0.0",
  "status": "in progress",
  "warnings": [],
  "stages": [
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646337782721,
      "name": "Back up content, database, and index directories",
      "startTime": 1646337782659,
      "state": "completed"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 0,
      "name": "Upgrade portal content",
      "startTime": 0,
      "state": "in progress"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 0,
      "name": "Upgrade database",
      "startTime": 0,
      "state": "not started"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 0,
      "name": "Migrate configuration settings",
      "startTime": 0,
      "state": "not started"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 0,
      "name": "Update configuration settings",
      "startTime": 0,
      "state": "not started"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 0,
      "name": "Configure index service",
      "startTime": 0,
      "state": "not started"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 0,
      "name": "Reindex",
      "startTime": 0,
      "state": "not started"
    }
  ],
  "messages": []
}
```

Once the upgrade has completed successfully, the `root` resource will return the following success response:

```javascript
{
  "upgradeFromVersion": "10.7.1",
  "upgradeToVersion": "11.0.0",
  "status": "success",
  "warnings": [],
  "stages": [
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646339105630,
      "name": "Back up content, database, and index directories",
      "startTime": 1646339105563,
      "state": "completed"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646339321902,
      "name": "Upgrade portal content",
      "startTime": 1646339106985,
      "state": "completed"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646339462088,
      "name": "Upgrade database",
      "startTime": 1646339106985,
      "state": "completed"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646339478570,
      "name": "Migrate configuration settings",
      "startTime": 1646339462089,
      "state": "completed"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646339478570,
      "name": "Update configuration settings",
      "startTime": 1646339462089,
      "state": "completed"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646339531393,
      "name": "Configure index service",
      "startTime": 1646339478570,
      "state": "completed"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646339689202,
      "name": "Reindex",
      "startTime": 1646339615524,
      "state": "completed"
    }
  ],
  "messages": [],
  "recheckAfterSeconds": 20
}
```

If the upgrade is complete, but there are action items that must be performed, the `root` resource will return a success response with a `warnings` property, which will contain information about those action items:

```javascript
{
  "upgradeFromVersion": "10.7.1",
  "upgradeToVersion": "11.0.0",
  "status": "success with warnings",
  "warnings": [
    "Failed to update the web server certificate configuration with the certificate in configStore."
  ],
  "stages": [
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646353243839,
      "name": "Back up content, database, and index directories",
      "startTime": 1646352892223,
      "state": "completed"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646353374026,
      "name": "Upgrade portal content",
      "startTime": 1646353246494,
      "state": "completed"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646353512931,
      "name": "Upgrade database",
      "startTime": 1646353246494,
      "state": "completed"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646353529552,
      "name": "Migrate configuration settings",
      "startTime": 1646353512931,
      "state": "completed"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646353529552,
      "name": "Update configuration settings",
      "startTime": 1646353512931,
      "state": "completed"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646353580805,
      "name": "Configure index service",
      "startTime": 1646353529552,
      "state": "completed"
    },
    {
      "lastUpdated": 1646353712761,
      "name": "Reindex",
      "startTime": 1646353650598,
