## Description

The `importRootOrIntermediate` operation imports a certificate authority's (CA) root and intermediate certificates into the key store.

To create a production-quality CA-signed certificate, you need to add the CA certificates into the key store that enables the SSL mechanism to trust the CA (and the certificates it has signed). While most of the popular CA certificates are already available in the key store, you can use this operation if you have a custom CA or specific intermediate certificates.

To import a signed certificate from a CA, use the [Import Signed Certificate](/import-signed-certificate-ha) operation.
