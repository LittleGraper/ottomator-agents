## Description

The `healthCheck` resource reports if the responding Portal for ArcGIS machine is able to receive and process requests. For example, before creating the portal, `healthCheck` may report the site is unavailable because it can't take requests at that time. An available portal machine will return an `HTTP 200` response code along with an page indicating the portal machine is ready. An unavailable portal machine will return messaging other than `HTTP 200`. If a machine is unavailable, even if format (`f`) is set as `json` or `pjson`, the response will return an HTML page. This resource is useful for setting up a third-party load balancer or other monitoring software that supports a health check function.

## Example usages

The following is a sample request URL used to access the `healthCheck` resource:

```javascript
https://machine.domain.com/webadaptor/portaladmin/healthCheck?f=pjson
```

<Note>

The request URL can be modified to use a port, such as port 7443, rather than through a site configured with a webadaptor. For these requests, the URL would be modified in the following way:

```other

https://machine.domain.com:7443/arcgis/portaladmin/healthCheck?f=pjson
```
</Note>

 

## JSON Response example

```other
{"status": "success"}
```
