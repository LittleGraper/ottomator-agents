## Description

The `config` returns the identity store information for ArcGIS Enterprise.

If ArcGIS Enterprise will be authenticated using ArcGIS Web Adaptor, you must set up your preferred authentication on your web server. Use the [Update Identity Store](/update-identity-store) operation to configure your organization to connect to your enterprise identity provider, such as Windows Domain or LDAP. By default, ArcGIS Enterprise is configured to use the built-in store and token-based authentication.

<Note>
The `enableRemoteUserTokenValidation` property enhances security by preventing a user from using a token generated by another user. This feature is only available when Web Tier Authentication is used.

For example, if user "Amy" obtains a token that was generated by "Bob", Amy can impersonate Bob by sending the token that was generated for Bob. However, when the `enableRemoteUserTokenValidation`  property is enabled, portal verifies that the token currently being used was issued for the same user account that was authenticated by the Web Server.
