## Description

The `mode` resource returns whether your ArcGIS Enterprise deployment has been set to read-only mode. When enabled, the Enterprise portal, connected hosting and federated servers, and ArcGIS Data Stores are all set into read-only mode. During this time, most POST requests and administrative functions are blocked. Users within your organization will still be able to view and access your content; however, attempts to create, modify or delete content or site properties will be blocked. To learn more about read-only mode, see [Read-only mode in ArcGIS Enterprise](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/read-only-mode-in-arcgis-enterprise.htm).

<Note type={"note"}>

The [Update](/update-mode) operation will only affect servers that had not previously been set to read-only mode. When `Update`  is used to enable read-only mode, servers that were originally set to read-only mode will not be affected. When `Update`  is used to disable read-only mode, those same servers will be unaffected and will remain in read-only mode.
