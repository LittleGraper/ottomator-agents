## Description

The resource for an individual web adaptor returns the properties of a web adaptor, such as its HTTP and HTTPS ports and description.

The ArcGIS Web Adaptor is a web application that runs in a front-end web server. One of the web adaptor's primary responsibilities is to forward HTTP requests from end users to Portal for ArcGIS. The web adaptor acts a reverse proxy, providing the end users with an entry point to the system, hiding the back-end servers, and providing some degree of immunity from back-end failures.

The front-end web server can authenticate incoming requests against your enterprise identity stores and provide specific authentication schemes such as Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA), HTTP Basic, or Digest.

Most importantly, a web adaptor provides your end users with a well-defined entry point to your system without exposing the internal details of your portal. Portal for ArcGIS will trust requests being forwarded by the web adaptor and will not challenge the user for any credentials. However, the authorization of the request (by looking up roles and permissions) is still enforced by the portal's sharing rules.
