## Description

The `emailSettings` resource returns the email settings that have been configured for an organization. These settings can be used to send out email notifications from ArcGIS Enterprise portal about password policy updates and user type, add-on, or organization capability license expirations, and allow members with built-in account to use an email-based workflow to [retrieve forgotten passwords](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/profile.htm#ESRI_SECTION2_B35C0C14BD0A4694BBF33798127292DF). Email notifications regarding policy changes and expiration notices will be sent to members listed under the organization's [administrative contacts](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/configure-general.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_15DC85DFC5894500B182829086BE6D7A).

<Note type={"warning"}>

Email notifications regarding license expiration will be sent out at an interval of 90 days, 60 days, 30 days, 3 days, 2 days, and 1 day before the licenses expire.
