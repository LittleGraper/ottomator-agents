## Description

The `refreshMembership` operation iterates over every enterprise account configured in an organization and determines if there are any change in memberships. If any changes are detected, the database and the indexes are updated for each group.

While ArcGIS Enterprise automatically refreshes the memberships during a user login and during a periodic refresh configured through the [Update Identity Store](/update-identity-store) operation, this operation allows an administrator to force a refresh.

<Note type={"note"}>

This operation is only supported if ArcGIS Enterprise is configured with enterprise groups. This operation may take a while to complete if there are a substantial number of enterprise users and groups.

</Note>
