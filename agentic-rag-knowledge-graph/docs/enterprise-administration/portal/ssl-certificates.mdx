## Description

The `sslCertificates` resource lists all the [certificates](/ssl-certificate) (self-signed and CA-signed) created for the portal machine as well as the certificates currently configured with ArcGIS Enterprise portal. This resource also provides access to operations that can be used to manage SSL certificates in a single machine environment.

Before you enable SSL for your organization, you need to [generate](/generate-certificate) certificates and get them signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). For your convenience, ArcGIS Enterprise is capable of generating self-signed certificates that can be used during development or staging. However, it is critical that you obtain CA-signed certificates when standing up a production server.

In order to get a certificate signed by a CA, you need to [generate a CSR](/generate-csr) (certificate signing request) and then submit it to your CA. The CA will sign your certificate request which can then be imported into the server by using the [import signed certificate](/import-signed-certificate) operation. ArcGIS Enterprise securely stores self-signed, CA-signed, and configured certificates inside a key store.
