## Description

The `reconfigure` operation re-creates the index service metadata, schema, and data in the event that they become corrupted. The `reconfigure` operation may not address out-of-sync indices where the counts in the database and index do not match.

<Note type={"caution"}>

It's recommended to perform the `reconfigure` operation during system maintenance or downtime, as the operation may take a while to finish. During this time, portal content and search operations will be unavailable until operation is complete and the index service may not respond to index queries.

</Note>
