## Description

The `export` operation exports and downloads either [standard logs](/query-logs) or audit logs as a .zip file. Audit logs are detailed event logs that are used to monitor changes to the system. Audit logs are a useful resource when troubleshooting any critical or breaking changes that have occured, as they can help track what organization member made a change, the effect it has on the system, and what time those events occurred. Notably, audit logs can be processed by Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools to generate an audit trail, track trends in user activity, as well as monitor and address any security threats or vulnerabilities.

Audit logs captures information for the following events:

* Accessing the organization portal site
* Creating, deleting, updating, and disabling member accounts
* Creating and updating user roles
* Adding and configuring groups
* Adding and removing members from a group
* Sharing items
* Changing item ownership
* Adding, updating, moving, and deleting items
