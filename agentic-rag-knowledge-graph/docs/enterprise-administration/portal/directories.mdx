## Description

The `directories` resource is a collection of directories that are used by the portal to store and manage content. There are five types of directories, four of which are returned by this endpoint:

- Content directory—The content directory contains the data associated with every item in the portal.
- Database directory—The built-in security store and sharing rules are stored in a [Database](/database) server that places files in the database directory. 
- Temporary directory—The temporary directory is used as a scratch workspace for all the portal's runtime components.
- Index directory—The index directory contains all the indexes associated with the content in the portal. The indexes are used for quick retrieval of information and for querying purposes.

The fifth is the log directory, which contains text files that are created when errors and warnings are encountered. Information for the log directory can be viewed in [Log Settings](/log-settings) resource, and its settings can be updated using the [Edit Log Settings](/edit-log-settings) operation.

<Note>

The [Edit Directory](/edit-directory) operation can be used to change the path for the content, database, temporary, and index directories.
