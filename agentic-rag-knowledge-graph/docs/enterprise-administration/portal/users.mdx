## Description

The `users` resource is an umbrella for operations to manage members within the organization. This resource returns the total number of members in the organization.

As an administrator, you can register enterprise accounts for your organization by using the [Create User](/create-user) operation. When automatic sign-in for users is disabled in the [Security Configuration](/security-configuration), registered enterprise accounts can sign in as members of the portal. This gives you full control on all the accounts within an organization.
