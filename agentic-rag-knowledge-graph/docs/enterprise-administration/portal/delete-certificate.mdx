## Description

The `delete` operation deletes an SSL certificate from the key store. Once a certificate is deleted, it cannot be retrieved or used to enable SSL.

<Note type={"note"}>

This operation is not accessible for highly available portals. In such instances, a counterpart [Delete Certificate](/delete-certificate-ha) operation should be used in its place. For more information on high availability, see [Configure a highly available portal](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/configuring-a-highly-available-portal.htm).
