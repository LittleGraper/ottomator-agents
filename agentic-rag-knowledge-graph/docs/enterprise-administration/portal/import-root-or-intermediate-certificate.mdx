## Description

The `importRootOrIntermediate` operation imports a certificate authority's (CA) root and intermediate certificates into the keystore.

To create a production quality CA-signed certificate, you need to add the CA certificates into the keystore that enables the SSL mechanism to trust the CA (and the certificates it has signed). While most of the popular CA certificates are already available in the keystore, you can use this operation if you have a custom CA or specific intermediate certificates.

To import a signed certificate from a CA, use the [Import Signed Certificate](/import-signed-certificate) operation.

<Note type={"note"}>

This operation is not accessible for highly available portals. In such instances, a counterpart [Import Root or Intermediate Certificate](/import-root-or-intermediate-certificate-ha) operation, found under the Machines resource, should be used in place of this operation. For more information on high availability, please see [Configure a highly available portal](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/configuring-a-highly-available-portal.htm).
