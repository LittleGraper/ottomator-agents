The ArcGIS Portal Administrator API allows you to perform administrative tasks that are not available in the ArcGIS Enterprise portal organization site. 

The API is organized into resources and operations. Resources are entities in Portal for ArcGIS that contain information and have a well-defined state. Operations act on these resources and update their information or state. Resources and operations are hierarchical and have unique URLs.

## Get started

The hierarchical root of the API begins with a well-defined URL called as the portal administration root URL. Typically, this is accessible at the following location:

```other
https://machine.domain.com/webadaptor/portaladmin
```

The various resources and operations that are used by the API are organized hierarchically from the root URL. For example, the API allows you to change the portal environment, such as security configuration, identity providers, content directory, and other system-wide properties. It also provides information about the current license level.

To access a resource or invoke an operation, you must create a request by doing the following:

1.  Generate a token from the sharing API by providing your administrative credentials.
2.  Access the API by providing the token.
3.  Construct a URL to the selected resource or operation as defined in the API reference.
4.  Provide the relevant parameters in their specified format.
5.  Access the URL over the prescribed HTTP method (typically GET or POST).

<Note type={"note"}>

If you are not directly interacting with Esri administrative or REST APIs (for example, using scripts or having a web app firewall configured), you may encounter query limitations. When a query string exceeds 2,048 characters in length, submit the query as a POST request.

</Note>

The API is stateless, which means the portal does not keep track of transactions from one request to the next. Each request must contain all the information necessary for successful processing. The portal processes each request and returns a well-defined response.

## ArcGIS Portal Administrator Site Directory

The ArcGIS Portal Administrator Site Directory, which is installed with Portal for ArcGIS, is a simple HTML interface that allows you to interact with the resources and operations used by the API. The Portal Directory is typically accessible at the following URL:

```other
https://machine.domain.com/webadaptor/portaladmin
```
