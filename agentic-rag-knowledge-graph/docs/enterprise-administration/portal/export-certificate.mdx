## Description

The `export` operation downloads a SSL certificate. The file returned by the server is an X.509 certificate. The downloaded certificate can be imported into a client that is making HTTP requests.

<Note type={"note"}>

This operation is not accessible for highly available portals. In such instances, a counterpart [Export Certificate](/export-certificate-ha) operation should be used in its place. For more information on high availability, see [Configure a highly available portal](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/configuring-a-highly-available-portal.htm).
</Note>

## Example usage

The following is a sample GET request for the `export` operation:
