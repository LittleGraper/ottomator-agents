## ArcGIS Enterprise release version


<AccordionItem title="ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4">

<Tabs>
<TabNav>
  <TabTitle>New endpoints</TabTitle>
  <TabTitle>Updated endpoints</TabTitle>
  <TabTitle>Deprecated endpoints</TabTitle>
</TabNav>

  <Tab>

  A new operation, [Export Logs](/export-logs), has been added. This operation can be used to export and download ether standard or audit logs as .zip files.

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

  ## Changes to user type licensing

  At ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4, the Partner user types (`liteUT`, `basicUT`, and `standardUT`) have been retired. Separate from these deprecations, the `GISProfessionalBasicUT` user type has been merged with the `creatorUT` user type. With this merge, users assigned the `creatorUT` user type will have access to the applications previously included with the `GISProfessionalBasicUT`.

  The deprecated or removed user types cannot be used as the default user type for an organization, cannot be set as the user type assigned to new users, and cannot be assigned to the default administrator account when creating an organization. For more information about roles and user types, see [User types, roles, and privileges](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/roles.htm).

  ## Updated endpoints

  * A new property, `contentSecurityPolicy`, can be set using the [Update Security Configuration](/update-security-configuration) operation. This property defines the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) response headers that are included when accessing the organization's portal website or any of its associated applications.
  * The [Update Token Configuration](/update-token-configuration) operation now generates a new base64 encoded key each time the operation is accessed. If the update is performed, the old shared key will be replaced by the generated key.
  * Performing the [Clean Logs](/clean-logs) operation will delete audit logs. Audit logs were introduced at 11.4. For more information, see the [Export Logs](/export-logs) operation.

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

  At ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4, ArcGIS License Manager is no longer supported. The [License](/license) resource no longer returns ArcGIS License Manager configuration information as part of its JSON response, and the [Update License Manager](/update-license-manager) endpoint has been deprecated.

      A new endpoint, [Hardware Info](/hardware), can be used by administrators to monitor the disk usage space for a portal machine.

    </Tab>

    <Tab>

      - The [System Properties](/system-properties) and [Update System Properties](/update-system-properties) endpoints have been updated to support a new property, `diskSpaceThresholdGB`. The `diskSpaceThresholdGB` property specifies the threshold of usable disk space.
      - The Import Existing Server Certificate operations for [single machine](/import-existing-server-certificate) and [multiple-machine environments](/import-existing-server-certificate-ha) have been updated to include the `importCertificateChain` parameter. The `importCertificateChain` parameter specifies if the operation should also import the root or intermediate certificates included inside the certificate file.
      - The [Create Site](/create-site) operation has been updated to support a new parameter, `enableDebug`. This parameter specifies the log level when creating a portal.
      - Logs for requests made through the Portal Admin API have a request ID associated with them. This request ID can be used to [query for logs](/query-logs/#request-ids) relating to a specific request that was made.

    </Tab>

    <Tab>

      At ArcGIS Enterprise 11.3, the GeoPlanner app has been retired. For additional details and transitioning recommendations, refer to this announcement. Licensing documentation that previously referenced GeoPlanner have had their references removed. The [Get App Info](/get-app-info) documentation has been updated to include a legacy notice for GeoPlanner.

      ### New parameters

      - The [Upgrade](/upgrade) operation now requires the `file` parameter when upgrading a portal from one release series to another (for example, upgrading from 10.9 to 11.1) or when upgrading in the same release series (for example, upgrading from 11.0 to 11.1).
      - A new parameter, `isReIndexRequired` , has been added to the [Upgrade](/upgrade) operation. The `isReIndexRequired`  specifies whether a full reindex is performed during the upgrade.
      - The [Export Site](/export-site) and [Import Site](/import-site) operations now support the `validate` parameter. The `validate` parameter ensures that the folder path or file location where the exported content will be written is accessible before performing the operation.

      ### New properties

      -  An `adminUrl` property has been added to the response for the [Validate Servers](/validate-servers) and [Validate Server](/validate-server) operations. The `adminUrl` property provides the administrative URL for a federated server.
      - Two new properties, `validFromEpoch` and `validUntilEpoch`, have been added to the responses for both the [SSL Certificate (Security)](/ssl-certificate) and [SSL Certificate (Machines)](/ssl-certificate-ha) resources. The `validFromEpoch` property provides the date and time information in Epoch format for the beginning of a certificate's validity. The `validUntilEpoch` property provides the date and time information in Epoch format for the ending of a certificate's validity.
      - The [Backup Restore Information](/backuprestoreinfo) resource has been updated to include a new property, `backupModeTimeStamp`, that provides date and time information, in Unix format, of the last backup of the organization when using `BACKUP` mode.
      - The [System Properties](/system-properties) resource has been updated to include a new property, `logBackupWarning`. The `logBackupWarning` property can disable backup warnings that appear in logs when the site's values for `fullBackupTimeStamp` or `backupModeTimeStamp` are older than two weeks. This property can be updated using the [Update System Properties](/update-system-properties) operation.

      ### Certificate management for multi-machine deployments

      The [Machines](/machines) resource has been updated to provide access to a series of licensing operations that allow for managing certificates for associated portal machines in a multi-machine (highly available) environment. Prior to this change, certificates had to be managed on each machine individually by accessing their instance of the Portal Administrator Directory API. The new endpoints are listed below:

      - [SSL Certificates (HA)](/ssl-certificates-ha) lists all certificates created for the Enterprise machines.
      - [SSL Certificate (HA)](/ssl-certificate-ha) returns specific details on an SSL certificate.
      - [Delete Certificate (HA)](/delete-certificate-ha) deletes an SSL certificate. This operation is only accessible for highly available Enterprise portals.
      - [Export Certificate (HA)](/export-certificate-ha) downloads an SSL certificate. This operation is only accessible for highly available Enterprise portals.
      - [Generate CSR (HA)](/generate-csr-ha) generates a certificate signing request for a self-signed certificate. This operation is only accessible for highly available Enterprise portals.
      - [Generate Certificate (HA)](/generate-certificate-ha) creates a self-signed certificate. This operation is only accessible for highly available Enterprise portals.
      - [Import Existing Server Certificate (HA)](/import-existing-server-certificate-ha) imports an existing certificate into the key store. This operation is only accessible for highly available Enterprise portals.
      - [Import Root or Intermediate Certificate (HA)](/import-root-or-intermediate-certificate-ha) imports a certificate authority's root and intermediate certificates into the key store. This operation is only accessible for highly available Enterprise portals.
      - [Import Signed Certificate (HA)](/import-signed-certificate-ha) imports a certificate authority signed SSL certificate into the key store. This operation is only accessible for highly available Enterprise portals.
      - [Update Web Server Certificate (HA)](/update-web-server-certificate-ha) configures properties, such as TLS protocols, used by the portal. This operation is only accessible for highly available Enterprise portals.


    </Tab>

    <Tab>

      - All endpoints in the Portal Administrative Directory API have been updated to require specific privileges to access their functionality. Access is based on the privileges included in either a user's custom or default role, enabling Enterprise portal administrators to restrict or grant access to the resources and operations that are associated with, and required by, their assigned privileges. For a list of the privileges required for each endpoint, see the [Manage Access](/privileges-for-portal-admin-api) documentation.
      - The [License](/license) resource has been updated to return information on user type extensions. [User type extensions](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/license-user-type-extensions.htm) are licenses that extend the capabilities of ArcGIS Enterprise for specific users in an organization. They can be included in a user type or as an add-on license that you assign to members of your organization.
      - The [Update Security Configuration](/update-security-configuration) operation is no longer used to set the default user type and default user role for new members. The defaults for new members are now configured on the **New Member Defaults** tab in the organization settings of the Enterprise portal or through the [Set User Default Settings](DEVSITE/rest/users-groups-and-items/set-user-default-settings/) operation in the Sharing API.
