## Description

The `unfederate` operation unfederates a currently federated ArcGIS Server from your organization. Before performing this operation, the federated server should be taken out of read-only mode if it was already in that state. This operation is not applicable to the hosting server configured as part of the base deployment of ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes.

<Note type={"caution"}>

Unfederating a server has several significant consequences and should not be done as part of routine troubleshooting. It is not easily undone and may have irreversible consequences. This operation should only be performed if you have a clear understanding of the impact the removal of a federated server will have on an organization.
