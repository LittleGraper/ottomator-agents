## Description

The `mode` resource checks whether ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes is set to read-only mode. When enabled, an organization and its connected hosting and federated servers and ArcGIS Data Store are set to read-only mode. During this time, most POST requests and administrative functions are blocked. Users in an organization can view and access existing content; however, they cannot create, modify, or delete content or site properties.
