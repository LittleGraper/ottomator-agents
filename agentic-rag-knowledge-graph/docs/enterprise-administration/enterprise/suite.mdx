## Description

The `suite` resource returns the name of, and short description for, the tests included in a specific suite. A suite is a grouping of predefined tests that are performed against the organization during a health check. Administrators cannot change the tests or choose which tests are performed from a specific suite. At ArcGIS Enterprise 11.2 on Kubernetes, administrators have access to a basic health check suite. Basic health check reports conduct a suite of functional and availability health checks to validate overall organization health.

More detailed test information is returned by the [Suites](/suites) resource. Both suite-related resources return a suite ID, which is used to [run a health check](/run-health-check), [export a health check report](/export-reports), or [delete a health check report](/delete-reports).
