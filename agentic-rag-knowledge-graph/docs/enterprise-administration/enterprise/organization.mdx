## Example usage

The following is a sample request URL used to access the `organization` resource:

```markdown
https://organization.domain.com/context/admin/orgs/0123456789ABCDEF?f=pjson
```

## JSON Response example

The following is a sample JSON response for an organization resource. The response returns a web adaptor registration token that is specific to the organization, created when the organization was configured. The token is a base64 encoded JSON string that includes the organization's ID, the shared key that establishes trust between the web adaptor and your ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes deployment, a list of nodes in the deployment, and the Ingress port. You will need to pass the token as part of the request when registering a web adaptor with your organization.
