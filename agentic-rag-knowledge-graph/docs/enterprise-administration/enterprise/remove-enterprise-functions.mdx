## Description

The `remove` operation disables a premium capability for an organization, such as raster analytics or image hosting.

This operation is performed asynchronously and will return a [job](/job) URL that can be used to check the status of the request. When the request is submitted, ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes checks to see if any other premium capabilities that share the same [System](/system-service-folder) and [Utility](/system-utilities-folder) services are currently enabled.

If another premium capability is still enabled, and both it and the capability being disabled share the same System and Utility services, those services are not stopped. For example, if `ImageHosting` is being disabled, but `RasterAnalytics` is still enabled, the System and Utility services used by both `ImageHosting` and `RasterAnalytics` are not disabled.

If no other premium capability is enabled, the System and Utility services are stopped.

<Note type={"note"}>

Once the request is submitted, the job will take some time to complete.
