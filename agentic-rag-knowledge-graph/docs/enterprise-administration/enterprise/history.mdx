## Description

The `history` resource returns the transaction history for all [Upgrade](/upgrade) and [Rollback](/rollback) operations that have been performed on an ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes deployment. The recorded transaction information includes the operation type (either `upgrade` or `rollback`), upgraded or rolled back version information for the deployment, status message (`success` or `failure`), and start and end time (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS`) for each operation.

<Note type={"note"}>

When representing the current and future versions of the deployment, the version and build numbers are combined. For example, if the deployment version is 10.9.0 and the build number is 505, the current version is returned as 10.9.0.505. The version number is updated with each installed release, and the build number is updated with each update (either patch or release) installed. This representation is returned through the HTML view of the API, as well as in the upgrade job messages retained by the `currentVersion` and `upgrades` resources.
