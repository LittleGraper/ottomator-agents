## Description

The `edit` operation edits the properties of a service. To edit a service, you need to submit the complete JSON representation of the service, which includes the updates to the service properties. Editing a service can cause the service to be restarted with updated properties.

The JSON representation of a service contains the following four sections:

- Service description properties—Common properties that are shared by all services. These properties typically identify a specific service.
- Service framework properties—Properties targeted toward the framework that hosts the GIS service. They define the life cycle and load balancing of the service.
- Service type properties—Properties targeted toward the core service type as seen by the server administrator. Since these properties are associated with a server object, they vary across the service types.
- Extension properties—Represent the extensions that are enabled on the service.

<Note type={"note"}>

The JSON is submitted to the operation URL as a value of the parameter service. You can leave out the `serviceName` and type parameters in the JSON representation. Any other properties that are left out are not persisted by the server.

</Note>

## JSON Response examples

If `async` is `false`, the following response is returned once a service is edited successfully:

```other
{"status": "success"}
```

If `async` is `true`, the following response is returned. The value returned for `jobsUrl` can be used to access the job resource to track a job's status after it's been submitted. For more information, see the [Job](/job) resource topic.

```other
{
  "jobsUrl": "https://organization.domain.com/context/admin/jobs/ja2ca1a35-881c-400c-a49a-b26883002d6c",
  "jobID": "ja2ca1a35-881c-400c-a49a-b26883002d6c",
  "jobStatus": "SUBMITTED"
}
