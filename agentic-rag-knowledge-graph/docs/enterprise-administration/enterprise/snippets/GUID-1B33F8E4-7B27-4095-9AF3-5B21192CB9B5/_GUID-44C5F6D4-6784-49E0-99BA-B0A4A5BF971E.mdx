ArcGIS Enterprise supports organization, feature service, and geoprocessing webhooks. The ArcGIS Portal Directory allows for the creation and management of organization webhooks, whereas the ArcGIS Server Administrative API Directory supports the creation and management of geoprocessing and feature service webhooks. For more information on organization webhooks in ArcGIS Enterprise, see either the ArcGIS Portal Directory API [webhook documentation](DEVSITE/rest/users-groups-and-items/create-webhooks) or the [Create webhooks](https://enterprise-k8s.arcgis.com/en/latest/administer/create-webhooks.htm) administrative documentation.
