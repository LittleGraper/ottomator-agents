## Description

The `federate` operation federates either a GIS Server, ArcGIS Image Server, or a Workflow Manager Server with an organization.

<Note type={"note"}>

Support for federating a Workflow Manager Server was added at ArcGIS Enterprise 11.2 on Kubernetes.

</Note>

The `federate` operation performs a validation check to determine whether the provided service and administrative URLs are accessible. If the resulting validation check fails, a warning is returned. A `SEVERE` log type is also returned in the organization's logs. After federation, administrators will be unable to set a server role for the federated server.

<Note type={"note"}>

Before federation, servers should be updated to use either CA or domain certificates. Currently, federating a server that uses a self-signed certificate is not supported.

</Note>

Once a server has been federated with an organization, services that exist on the ArcGIS Server site at the time of federation are automatically added to the portal as items. The administrator who performs this operation will be assigned as the imported service's owner and, once the operation is complete, can reassign ownership to other members in the organization. Any subsequent items published to the federated server are automatically added as items on the portal and are owned by the user who publishes them.
