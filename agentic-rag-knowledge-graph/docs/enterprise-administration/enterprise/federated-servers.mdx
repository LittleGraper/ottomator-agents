## Description

The `servers` resource returns detailed information about your organization's federated servers, such as each server's ID, name, and administration URL. ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes currently supports the following as federated servers:

- GIS Server
- Image Server
- Workflow Manager Server (support added at 11.2)

<Note type={"note"}>

The hosting server included in the base deployment of ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes is not listed because built-in servers are not returned by this resource.

</Note>

## Example usage

The following is a sample request URL used to access the `servers` resource:

```other
https://organization.domain.com/context/admin/orgs/0123456789ABCDEF/federation/servers?f=pjson
```

## JSON Response example

The example below demonstrates a response that is returned by `servers` when the organization has one federated server:

```other
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "serverRole": "FEDERATED_SERVER",
      "webgisServerTrustKey": "",
      "isHosted": false,
      "name": "machine.domain.com:6443",
      "id": "6DdBQL7vPJu2meMS",
      "adminUrl": "https://organization.domain.com:6443/context",
      "serverFunction": "",
      "url": "https://organization.domain.com/context"
    }
  ]
}
```

The example response below is returned when there are no federated servers associated with the organization. The hosting server included in the base deployment of ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes will not be returned through either the HTML or JSON view of this resource.

```other
{"servers": []}
```
