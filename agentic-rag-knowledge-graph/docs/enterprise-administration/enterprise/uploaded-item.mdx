## Description

The resource for an item uploaded to the server. Various workflows upload items and then process them on the server. For example, when publishing a GIS service from ArcGIS Pro, the application first uploads the service definition (`.SD`) to the server and then invokes the publishing geoprocessing tool to publish the service.

The resource for the uploaded item returns the following information for the uploaded item:

- Item ID (`itemID`)—A unique identifier that is specific to each uploaded item.
- Description (`description`)—If a description was added to the uploaded item as part of the upload request, it will be reflected in this property.
- Item Name (`itemName`)—The file name of the uploaded item.
- Date (`date`)—The date the item was uploaded, represented in milliseconds from epoch.
- Committed (`committed`)—This property returns as true when the upload of individual parts is completed.
- Content Type (`contentType`)—The content type of the uploaded file, for example, `application/octet-stream`.

<Note type={"note"}>

If the uploaded item is not made up of any parts, the parts list is empty.
