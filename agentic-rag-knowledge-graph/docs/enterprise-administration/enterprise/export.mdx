## Example usage

The following is a sample POST request for the `export` operation:

```other
POST /context/admin/system/upgrades/history/exports/64426e0b-1089-4500-863e-2dc58ddbdc35 HTTP/1.1
Host: organization.domain.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: []

datatype=warningsEvents&token=aOjrLVEnRpuwfgK-G-PGdyWUQhpJDlGVAt70Z3vrHd1mihME8yx8E1EgRCoIpl3mLm2DSDVjFVbyFeQVD_Sp6DrXAIrwED7NYmMTF_GkLurVWAe-MBROTxqu5781_8qj5S_3tqoINj6OmjG8zfeztCKTUCbV-xrsNp5-50g2-UCX62H_qT0r1fIgqh_KFsFF9f3cC9kzWum47eRH9PmmZHdKGN3XjY3GghswTGCELNJbEQ_q84sz8zYE5q6jx8Cl

```

## Accessing the export data

Once the export request is submitted, the page will redirect to an [asynchronous job resource](/job). To download the export information, navigate to the [uploaded item](/uploaded-item) in the Enterprise Admin directory or use the URL returned in the job's details to directly access the uploaded item.

```other
{
  "result": {"URL": "https://organization.domain.com/context/admin/uploads/5d3ee06f-2f77-45fd-bf2d-1459fc2b1e31"},
  "updatedtime": 1681770556182,
  "jobid": "ja2570377-d41a-48c5-b7c7-4b2f7d31ab9b",
  "resource": {"name": "Upgrade warnings and events"},
  "requestID": "2a31cb79-1738-4288-ade1-4d72cc911798",
  "name": "exportUpgradeEventsAndWarnings",
  "endtime": 1681770556186,
  "starttime": 1681770555920,
  "operationURI": "/arcgis/admin/system/upgrades/history/exports/17e97078-3cd6-465a-997f-aa9cac33d7e7",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "username": "administrator"
}
```

Choosing to [download](/download-uploaded-item) the upgrade data will download a `.zip` folder containing the warning and event information from the upgrade.
