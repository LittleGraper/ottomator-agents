## Description

The `notificationStatus` resource returns a list of timestamp information for when an attempt to deliver a payload has failed. A failure is reached when the number of attempts made to deliver the webhook payload to the receiver has been met and no response has been received from the receiver. When the maximum number of allowed failures is met, the webhook will be deactivated. This resource can be cleared of the logged failures by [deactivating](/deactivate-all-webhooks) and [reactivating](/activate-all-webhooks) the service webhooks for a specific service. For more information on delivery attempts and the deactivation policy, see the [Settings](/webhooks-settings) operation documentation.
