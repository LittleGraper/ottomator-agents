## Description

The `jobs` resource provides access to operations that locate and monitor current asynchronous jobs being run by a geoprocessing service. From the `jobs` resource, you can [query](/query-gp-service-job) for jobs using filters such as the start and end time for the job, the job's status, or the username of the user who submitted the job.

After a job has been completed, either failing or succeeding, it remains in the system until the system cleans it based on internal criteria, and at a defined cleanup interval (determined by the `CleanGPJobs` [task](/tasks)).
