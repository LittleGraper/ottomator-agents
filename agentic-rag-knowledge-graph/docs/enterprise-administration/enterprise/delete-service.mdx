## Example usage

The following is a sample POST request for the `delete` operation:

```other
POST /context/admin/services/testService.MapServer/delete HTTP/1.1
Host: organization.domain.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: []

async=false&f=pjson&token=Mb0ORrkLObNO2Q8FZoUCHHzSMzZi0CbhLHNRYMqqa6URG_ojQJF3rNsJAfRB23MyCrLwSmuaHPUo4AEIrUuoH1-4Ot5xh4565FtlQahXAhK2C7Sy0oydZhBwD8KdFSnVlnLr-e9uI5ovSWZ2lGNn9SwoV2MPMzeAh_5r-q-wgwF8DTT_nhuCXJGkMRy-48jjGS2aN5FI18STHZ8RAuKxGasH90SI3C7njZzlGCUrY5m6BDhCMsdpZA14GwNX8Cis

```

## JSON Response examples

If `async` is `false`, the following response is returned once a service is deleted successfully:

```other
{"status": "success"}
```

If `async` is `true`, the following response is returned. The value returned for `jobsUrl` can be used to access the job resource to track a job's status after it's been submitted. For more information, see the [Job](/job) resource topic.

```other
{
  "jobsUrl": "https://organization.domain.com/context/admin/jobs/ja2ca1a35-881c-400c-a49a-b26883002d6c",
  "jobID": "ja2ca1a35-881c-400c-a49a-b26883002d6c",
  "jobStatus": "SUBMITTED"
}
