## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

This resource has been deprecated with the release of ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes 10.9.1. The child operations and resources previously located under `backuprestore` have relocated within the [Disaster Recovery](/disaster-recovery) section of the ArcGIS Enterprise Administrator API. See the [resource hierarchy](/resource-hierarchy) for an updated site structure of the disaster recovery endpoints.

</Note>

This resource provides access to the existing backups of an organization, as well as the ability to [create a backup](/create-backup) and [check the status](/status) of a current backup.
