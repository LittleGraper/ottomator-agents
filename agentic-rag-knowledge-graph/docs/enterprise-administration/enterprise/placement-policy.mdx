## Description

The `placementPolicy` resource returns the current node affinity and tolerations that are applied to a GIS service’s pods. By utilizing node affinity and tolerations, administrators can have the pods for a specific service be scheduled to, or repelled from, specific nodes. For example, an administrator could use node affinity and tolerations to ensure that a GIS service’s pods are scheduled to nodes that have higher capacity, nodes that have a specific type of GPU, or prevent pods of other components from being scheduled on specific nodes. The `placementPolicy` resource also provides access to the [Edit (Placement Policy)](/edit-placement-policy) operation, which is used to define or modify the node affinity and toleration values for a specific service.
