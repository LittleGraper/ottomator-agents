## Description

The `delete` operation removes a specific backup from a deployment. This operation cannot be reversed. Before performing this operation, take time to ensure that critical data won't deleted by mistake. Once the operation is complete, the backup files are permanently removed from the backup store and cannot be retrieved.

If `true`, the operation is run asynchronously and the response returns a JSON object containing job information that can be used to track the job's status. The default value is `false`.

Values: `true` | `false`

```other
POST /context/admin/system/disasterrecovery/backuprestore/backups/backup/delete HTTP/1.1
Host: organization.domain.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: []

async=false&f=pjson&token=HRozb6bnTL6gfA-SJO-IxhfLgJrioK1KJdMLWmCE5HjHWz9U3fOiFv3-HkgPZqsLljTkk2WDENGt5fjho5s39e_mZL5At60UvJPoNnC5O2sv2HTlumG7TsYfbtnokpWmS6-lf8XoQpSKusZwmxIkEMP-yE0Wxrj8o9sWKi29J-pxzkoCDhoUfdLt6NnBWxhESpegh8BzNcEruqxuDQD-JRmaTsbRDaBHTQTePMzQePhXl7KcEG9Cfkw2sa7P1W1e

```

## JSON Response examples

The following response is returned, if `async` is `false`, when a backup is successfully deleted:

```other
{"status": "success"}
```

If `async` is `true`, the response returns a JSON object containing job information. The value returned for the `jobsUrl` property can be used to access the job resource, which can be polled to return updated job status information. For more information, see the [Job](/job) resource topic.

```other
{
  "jobsUrl": "https://organization.domain.com/context/admin/jobs/j7c8820d0-ea2f-427a-ab6f-a8cc2c927fe4",
  "jobid": "j7c8820d0-ea2f-427a-ab6f-a8cc2c927fe4",
  "status": "SUBMITTED"
}
