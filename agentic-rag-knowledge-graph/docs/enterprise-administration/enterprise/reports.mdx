## Description

The `reports` resource provides access various operations that aid in managing the health check reports for an organization. The [Query](/query-reports) operation returns all health check reports for an organization, and provides the report IDs used to identify which repots should be exported or deleted. The [Export](/export-reports) operation bundles specified health check reports into a .zip file that administrators can download to access CSV and JSON versions of the reports. The [Delete](/delete-reports) operation permanently deletes specified reports from an organization.
