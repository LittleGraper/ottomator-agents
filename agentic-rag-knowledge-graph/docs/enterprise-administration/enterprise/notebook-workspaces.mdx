## Description

The `workspaces` resource returns a notebook workspace that is registered with your organization. The properties of a workspace include properties defined during the workspace creation, as well as auto-generated information provided after the workspace was created (the `mountPath` and `id` properties). This resource also provides access to the [Create](/create-notebook-workspace) operation that administrators can use to create a notebook workspace.  


Only one notebook workspace can be registered with your ArcGIS Enterprise Organization. The Workspaces resource will return the information for this workspace.
