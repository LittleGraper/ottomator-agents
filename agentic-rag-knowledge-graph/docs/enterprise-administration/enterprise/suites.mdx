## Description

The `suites` resource returns a list of all suites that administrators can use to generate health check reports for their organization. Each [suite](/suite) is a grouping of predefined tests that are performed against the organization during a health check. Administrators cannot change the tests or choose which tests are performed from a specific suite. At ArcGIS Enterprise 11.2 on Kubernetes, administrators have access to a basic health check suite.

Along with the list of suites, this resource returns the tests included in each suite that will be performed during a health check, as well as the suite's ID, which is used to [run a health check](/run-health-check).
