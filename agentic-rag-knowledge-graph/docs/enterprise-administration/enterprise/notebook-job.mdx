## Description

A job resource returns the progress and status messages of a Notebook automation job, such as `executeNotebooks`, web tools, scheduled tasks, and notebook webhooks. Updated progress information can be acquired by periodically querying this resource. An administrator will be able to view jobs owned by any user, and a non-administrative notebook user will only be able to see notebook jobs of their own. The job resource is removed after a job is completed successfully or if there is a failure. Notebook job information can also be obtained from the [admin jobs](/jobs) resource.
