## Description

The `rollback` operation uninstalls a patch, removing the updates and fixes that had been applied to specific containers, and restoring the deployment to a previous, user-specified version of the software. The `rollback` operation cannot be performed for release-based updates.

<Note type={"caution"}>

While this operation can be used to roll back installed patches, performing a rollback should not be the first step in a troubleshooting workflow. It is recommended that administrators first meet with their organization's account managers, or contact Esri Support, to properly diagnose and troubleshoot the issue before calling this operation.

</Note>

The organization will be placed into read-only mode while a rollback is occurring.

<Note type={"note"}>

When the current version of the deployment is being represented, the version and build numbers are combined. For example, if the version of the deployment is 10.9.0, and the build is 505, the current version is returned as 10.9.0.505. The version number will be updated with each installed release, while the build number will be updated with each installed update (either patch or release). This representation is returned through the HTML view of the API, as well as in the upgrade job messages retained by the [Current Version](/current-version) and [Upgrades](/upgrades) resources. For an example of these messages, see the [JSON Response example](#json-response-example) section below.

</Note>

## Example usage

The following is a sample POST request for the `rollback` operation:

```other
POST /context/admin/system/upgrades/rollback HTTP/1.1
Host: organization.domain.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: []

versionManifest={"id": "pat_345432_505"}&rollbackSettings={}&f=pjson&token=ugW_uEP1WiJV7PkHhb2BU-f1C30eAZclpgOKE599aSIFxwYBNRc8O7h6sjjgzC3l3NxhPjpa-6zgeun7rB6xCizGstMk9ZcTgLeOc67dWbTsrn7A7_VzvfpC2cV2Ig77h6w0_mvhbaMTmpnzOek7tY85PguVExKeM-ODE5L2NTX2z9LM5URYviKA4nJu7Oyg3xBKwZzxXnhPUxpiCxUy5rZ_C9QRS6kNnZjNcvhAp6Dw2FE6hL6wnLIjk3H9IjvY

```

## JSON Response example

The following example demonstrates the immediate JSON response returned by a successful `rollback` request. Detailed, real-time job information is returned on the [upgrades](/upgrades) resource while the patch is being uninstalled.

```other
{
  "status": {
    "state": "in_progress",
    "code": 1,
    "messages": [
      {
        "message": "Starting the rollback process from 10.9.0.506 to 10.9.0.505.",
        "when": 1602276011623,
        "code": 2072
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Once the rollback process is complete, the JSON view of the `upgrades` resource will return the full job messages of the job and success status. Abbreviated information is denoted by `...`:

```other

  "status": {
    "code": 3,
