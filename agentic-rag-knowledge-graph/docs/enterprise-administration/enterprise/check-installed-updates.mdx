## Example usage

The following is a sample POST request for the `installed` operation:

```other
POST /context/admin/system/upgrades/installed HTTP/1.1
Host: organization.domain.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: []

f=pjson&token=HRozb6bnTL6gfA-SJO-IxhfLgJrioK1KJdMLWmCE5HjHWz9U3fOiFv3-HkgPZqsLljTkk2WDENGt5fjho5s39e_mZL5At60UvJPoNnC5O2sv2HTlumG7TsYfbtnokpWmS6-lf8XoQpSKusZwmxIkEMP-yE0Wxrj8o9sWKi29J-pxzkoCDhoUfdLt6NnBWxhESpegh8BzNcEruqxuDQD-JRmaTsbRDaBHTQTePMzQePhXl7KcEG9Cfkw2sa7P1W1e

```

## JSON Response example

The response example below demonstrates a deployment with an installed patch:

<Note type={"note"}>

When representing the current version of the deployment, the version and build numbers are combined. For example, if the deployment version is 10.9.0, and the build number is 505, the current version is returned as 10.9.0.505. The version number is updated with each installed release, while the build number is updated with each update (either patch or release) that is installed. This representation is returned through the HTML view of the API, as well as in the upgrade job messages retained by the `currentVersion` and `upgrades` resources.
