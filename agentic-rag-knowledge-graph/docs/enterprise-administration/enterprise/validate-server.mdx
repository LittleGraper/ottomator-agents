## Example usage

```markdown
https://organization.domain.com/context/admin/orgs/0123456789ABCDEF/federation/servers/vlQpWOiz9oEooY64/validate?f=pjson
```

## JSON Response examples

The following is a sample success response for `validate`:

```other
{
  "messages": [
    "ArcGIS Server administration URL 'https://organization.domain.com:6443/context' is accessible.",
    "Successfully validated the ArcGIS Server license.",
    "ArcGIS Server 'https://organization.domain.com:6443/context' version is compatible with Portal for ArcGIS."
  ],
  "status": "success",
  "serverId": "kt3o60bzVzLRNugQ"
}
```

The following example demonstrates a `success with warnings` response for `validate`. For this sample response, the message indicates that the federated server does not have ArcGIS Data Store registered as a managed database:

```other
{
  "messages": [
    "ArcGIS Server administration URL 'https://organization.domain.com:6443/context' is accessible.",
    "Successfully validated the ArcGIS Server license.",
    "ArcGIS Server 'https://organization.domain.com:6443/context' version is compatible with Portal for ArcGIS.",
    "The federated server does not have an ArcGIS Data Store registered as a managed database and cannot be set as a hosting server."
  ],
  "status": "success with warnings",
  "serverId": "kt3o60bzVzLRNugQ"
}
```

Responses may return other `status` types, such as `failure` and `undetermined`.
