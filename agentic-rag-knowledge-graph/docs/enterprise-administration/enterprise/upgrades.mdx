## Description

The `upgrades` resource provides access to child operations and resources that are used to manage the release and patch updates that can be applied to an ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes deployment. During the upgrade process, this resource returns detailed, real-time messages regarding the status and progress of the upgrade. While an upgrade is in progress, child operations and resources for this resource will be inaccessible. Once completed, all child endpoints will be operational, and the JSON view of the resource will contain a log of the job messages and the completion status.

<Note type={"note"}>

When the current version of the deployment is represented, the version and build number are combined. For example, if the deployment version is 10.9.0 and the build number is 505, the current version is returned as 10.9.0.505. The version number is updated with each installed release, and the build number is updated with each update (either patch or release) installed. This representation is returned through the HTML view of the API, as well as in the upgrade job messages retained by the `currentVersion` and `upgrades` resources. For an example of these messages, see the [JSON Response examples](/upgrades#json-response-examples) section below.

```

## JSON Response examples

The response example below is returned when the base ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes deployment has not had a patch or release upgrade installed:

```other
{
  "status": {
    "code": 0,
    "messages": [],
    "state": "no_upgrade"
  }
}
```

The following is a sample JSON response that is returned when a patch upgrade has been successfully installed:

```other
{
  "status": {
    "state": "success",
    "code": 3,
    "messages": [
      {
