  ## Changes to user type licensing

  At ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4, the Partner user types (`liteUT`, `basicUT`, and `standardUT`) have been retired. Separate from these deprecations, the `GISProfessionalBasicUT` user type has been merged with the `creatorUT` user type. With this merge, users assigned the `creatorUT` user type will have access to the applications previously included with the `GISProfessionalBasicUT`.

  The deprecated or removed user types cannot be used as the default user type for an organization, cannot be set as the user type assigned to new users, and cannot be assigned to the default administrator account when creating an organization. For more information about roles and user types, see [User types, roles, and privileges](https://enterprise-k8s.arcgis.com/en/latest/administer/roles.htm).

  ## Updated endpoints

  * A new property, `contentSecurityPolicy`, can be set using the [Update Security Configuration](/update-security-configuration) operation. This property defines the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) response headers that are included when accessing the organization's portal website or any of its associated applications.
  * The [Configure](/configure) operation's `cloudConfig` parameter has been updated to support registering cloud-native relational data stores with your deployment.
  * The [Upgrade](/upgrade) operation has two new parameters, `volumesConfig` and `cloudConfig`, which are used to specify the storage volume requirements and cloud service configuration and credentials for cloud-native relational object store during the upgrade process.
  * The [Create Task](/create-task) operation has been updated to support scheduling health check reports.

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

  At ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4, ArcGIS License Manager is no longer supported. The [License](/organization-license) resource no longer returns ArcGIS License Manager configuration information as part of its JSON response, and the [Update License Manager](/update-license-manager) endpoint has been deprecated.

  * A new operation, [Release License](/release-license), has been added that allows administrators to check in an organization member's license for either ArcGIS Pro or Drone2Map when the member is unable to check the license in themselves.
  * A new resource, [Container Images](/container-images), returns a list of container images that have been pulled and used to deploy applications for ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes.

  ## Volume expansion

  Starting at 11.3, ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes supports volume expansion for system-managed object, spatiotemporal, and relational data stores. Administrators can edit the storage values for the data store deployment's PersistentVolumeClaim, which also expands the underlying volume for that data store. The following documentation has been added for the new resources and operations added for volume expansion:
    - [Volumes (Data Store)](/data-store-volumes)
    - [Edit (Data Store Volumes)](/edit-data-store-volumes)
    - [Status (Data Store Volumes)](/data-store-volumes-status)

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

  - The [Update (Disaster Recovery Settings)](/update-settings) operation now supports setting the`provisioningType` as  `STATIC` for the PersistentVolumeClaim for backup and resotre operations.
  - Organizations can now implement device plugins to enable GPU nodes in their cluster to optimize workflows for raster analytics and deep learning. The following documentation has been updated to show the new `customResources` object that specifies the values requests ad limits for GPU:
    - [Deployment Properties](/deployment-default-properties)
    - [Default Properties](/deployment-property-template)
    - [Edit (Default Properties)](/edit-deployment-properties)
    - [Deployment](/deployment)
    - [Edit (Deployment)](/edit-deployment)
  - The Configure operation has seen two changes for the [Azure blob storage values](/configure/#azure-blob-storage) for the `cloudConfig` parameter:
    - Prior to 11.3, system-assigned managed identities were referred to as managed identities.
    - User-assigned managed identities are now supported

  - [Report](/health-check-report)
  - [Rename](/rename-report)

  ## Node affinity and tolerations

  At this release, administrators have the ability to set node affinity and tolerations for the pods of GIS services and the upgrade job, which is created whenever an upgrade or update occurs. Node affinity allows for pods to be scheduled to nodes that have matching label key-value pairs, whereas tolerations allow for pods to be scheduled on tainted nodes that would otherwise repel them if not for matching toleration and taint key-value pairs.

  The following documentation has been added to this publication to serve as a reference for creating and modifying placement policies for GIS services:

  - [Placement Policy](/placement-policy)
  - [Edit (Placement Policy)](/edit-placement-policy)

  The following documentation has been added to serve as a reference for creating and modifying a placement policy for the upgrade job:

  - [Configuration (Upgrades)](/upgrade-configurations)
  - [Update (Upgrades Configuration)](/update-upgrade-configurations)

  ## Local and ephemeral volumes

  Administrators can now provide volume configurations and volume configuration templates, which allow specific volumes to be attached to service pods, granting access to data or configurations needed by the service. The following documentation has been added to this publication to serve as a reference for creating persistent and ephemeral volumes:

  - [Volumes](/volumes)
  - [Create (Volumes)](/create-volumes)
  - [Configurations (Volumes)](/volumes-configurations)
  - [Create (Volumes Configurations)](/create-volume-configurations)

  ## Cloud providers and services

  Support for cloud-native storage has been added at this release. Cloud storage can be configured when configuring an organization, and administrators can manage the credentials for the cloud providers and services using the Cloud APIs. The following documentation has been added to this publication to serve as a reference on managing a deployment's cloud-native storage:

  - [Cloud](/cloud)
  - [Providers](/providers-1)
  - [Provider](/provider)
  - [Update Credentials](/provider-connection)
  - [Services (Cloud)](/cloud-services)
  - [Service (Cloud Services)](/cloud-service)
  - [Add Credentials](/service-connection)

  ## Premium capabilities

  ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes now supports two new premium capabilities: raster analytics and image hosting. These premium capabilities can be enabled through the ArcGIS Enterprise Administrator API, so long as the organization has the appropriate licensing and meets the specific requirements for the premium capability they want to enable. The following documentation has been added to this publication to serve as a reference for enabling and disabling premium capabilities for an organization:

  - [Enterprise Functions](/enterprise-functions)
  - [Add (Enterprise Functions)](/add-enterprise-functions)
  - [Remove (Enterprise Functions)](/remove-enterprise-functions)

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

  - Service webhooks have been updated to use signature verification to ensure the integrity and security of webhook payloads sent from ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes to a webhook receiver. Service webhooks can now be [created](/create-webhooks) or [updated](/edit-webhook) to use this new security measure.
  - The [Settings (Logs)](/log-settings) and [Edit (Log Settings)](/edit-log-settings) endpoints have been updated to support a new log retention policy. Administrators can now define the maximum number of days logs will be retained before they are deleted.
  - A new parameter, `cloudConfig`, has been added to the [Configure](/configure) operation. This parameter allows administrators to set native-cloud storage for the deployment.
  - Support has been added for two new [system properties](/system-properties). These new properties can be set using the [Update System Properties](/update-system-properties) operation:
    - `arcgis.com.map.url`: Specifies the URL to use for the ArcGIS Online Map Viewer preview link.
    - `arcgis.com.map.text`: Modifies the text to use for the ArcGIS Online Map Viewer preview link.
  - ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes now supports version 2 (v2) of autoscaling. Prior to 11.2, autoscaling could be configured using the beta version of v2 autoscaling (v2beta2). Organizations using ArcGIS Enterprise 10.9.1 on Kubernetes have access to version 1 (v1) of autoscaling. The following documentation has been updated to highlight the changes in autoscaling version support:
    - [Edit (Scaling)](/edit-scaling)
    - [Create Service](/create-service)
    - [Edit (Default Properties)](/edit-deployment-properties)
    - [Edit (Deployment)](/edit-deployment)

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

  Starting at this release, administrators will no longer be able to access Grafana through the metrics viewer app. While administrators working with ArcGIS Enterprise 11.2 on Kubernetes no longer have access to Grafana through the API, Grafana can still be installed separately and used with Prometheus through the metrics API. Deployments using versions 11.1 and earlier still have access to Grafana through the metrics viewer app.

  ## New operations and resources

  - [Exports](/exports)—This resource returns a list of previously run upgrades or updates that encountered errors during the upgrade process.
  - [Export](/export)—This operation exports upgrade data, uploaded to the deployment as a .zip file, that can be downloaded and used to troubleshoot post-upgrade.

  ## Service webhooks

  Support for feature service and geoprocessing service webhooks has been added to the ArcGIS Enterprise Administrator API. Feature service webhooks allow administrators to subscribe to event triggers pertaining to a feature service in their organization. Though geoprocessing services do not have specific event triggers that administrators can subscribe to, geoprocessing service webhooks will be invoked when a geoprocessing service job is completed. The following documentation has been added to this publication to serve as references for the service webhook endpoints:

  - [Webhooks](/webhooks)
  - [Create (Webhooks)](/create-webhooks)
  - [Delete All](/delete-all-webhooks)
  - [Deactivate All](/deactivate-all-webhooks)

  - [Export Geodatabase License](/export-geodatabse-license)—This operation downloads a `geodatabaseLicense.ecp` file that represents the authorization file needed when enabling, creating, and updating an enterprise geodatabase in ArcGIS Pro.
  - [Export Logs](/export-logs)—This operation exports organization logs based on either query or search parameters.
  - [External Content](/external-content)—This resource returns whether access to external content has been enabled or disabled for an organization.
  - [Update (External Content)](/update-external-content)—This operation enables and disables access to Esri-provided content containing external URLs that reference sites and resources hosted outside of the organization.

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

  ## Updated operations and resources

  - The [Create Service](/create-service) operation now supports version 2 of the autoscaling feature. The newest version of autoscaling allows for the `min`, `max`, `scalingMode`, and `averageUtilization` values to be passed through during a service's creation.
  - The [Languages](/languages) resource, as well as the [Add](/add-language) and [Remove](/remove-languages) child operations, now support `Bulgarian` (Български) as an Esri-supported language.
  - A new parameter, options, was added to both the [Register Item](/register-data-store-item) and [Validate Data Item](/validate-data-item) operations. The parameter supports a JSON array of additional properties used during data item registration and validation. Currently, this parameter only supports the `allowServicesRestart` property. By setting `allowServicesRestart` to `true`, administrators are acknowledging that registering a new file share location will disrupt their organization. Not providing `allowServicesRestart`, or setting it to `false`, will cause the registration of the new file share location to fail.
  - The [Register](/register), [Register Item](/register-data-store-item), and [Validate Data Item](/validate-data-item) operations now support asynchronous jobs. If run asynchronously, a [job](/job) is created for the request, which can be checked occasionally to monitor progress and view status messages.

  ## Autoscaling in ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes

  Introduced at ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes 10.9.1 with version 1 of the autoscaling feature, 11.0 introduces version 2 of autoscaling in ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes. Autoscaling allows administrators to configure and deploy systems that respond to unexpected performance demands with minimal intervention and overhead. The ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes autoscaling capability uses [horizontal pod autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/), which, in response to an increase in resource usage, deploys additional pods according to the values set by the administrator.

  The following resources and operations have been updated to return information on, or enable, autoscaling and should be referenced for more information on the properties and values needed to enabled autoscaling:

  - [Scaling](/scaling)
  - [Edit Scaling](/edit-scaling)
  - [Create Service](/create-service)
  - [Deployment Default Properties](/deployment-default-properties)
  - [Default Properties](/deployment-property-template)
  - [Edit Default Properties](/edit-deployment-properties)
  - [Deployment](/deployment)
  - [Edit](/edit-deployment)

  ## Licensing updates

  Licensing has been consolidated to a single license file at ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes 11.0. The ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes license file contains the ArcGIS Enterprise portal user types and add-on licenses and capabilities needed for a deployment. Management for the ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes license file is provided by the [organization-level `license` resource and child operations](/organization-license). The system-level `licenses` resource and `importServerLicenses` operation have been deprecated.

  ## Upgrade changes for ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes

  <Note type={"note"}>

  When a [required update](https://enterprise-k8s.arcgis.com/en/latest/administer/understand-updates.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_2AC54732EA2345B18395DD2FDC0ED41D) is available, you must apply it before upgrading to 11.0 or a subsequent release. Required updates include functional requirements and are a prerequisite to the latest software release. Review the [release notes](https://enterprise-k8s.arcgis.com/en/latest/introduction/release-notes.htm) to learn about issues addressed in the latest required update. 

  </Note>

  Starting with this release, before performing an [upgrade](/upgrade), you must retrieve the [required upgrade settings](/get-upgrade-settings) that will be passed through as part of the `upgrade` operation. Some settings require user input before they can be used during an upgrade. Currently, the object supports the following three upgrade settings: `updateToLatestPatch`, `licenseUpload`, and `volumesConfig`.

  - [Properties (Organization)](/organization-properties)—This resource lists properties specific to an organization that can be modified to control your deployment.
  - [Configuration (Data Store)](/configure-data-store)—This resource returns the current minimum and maximum resource allocations for a relational data store.
  - [Edit (Data Store Configuration)](/update-datastore-configuration)—This operation updates the resource allocation for a relational data store.
  - [Container Registry](/container-registry)—This resource returns information for a specific container registry, including the registry login credentials.
  - [Container Registries](/container-registries)—This resource returns the container registries associated with your deployment.
  - [Edit (Container Registry)](/edit-container-registry)—The operation allows for certain container registry properties to be updated after your organization has been configured.
  - [Update (Backup)](/update-backup-properties)—This operation updates the set retention date for a backup.
  - [Update (Backup Store)](/unregister-backup-store)—This operation updates the properties for a backup store. Currently, this is limited to setting the backup store as the default store for your deployment.
  - [Validate (Backup Store)](/validate-backup-store)—This operation validates that the backup store is able to access the object store and that the backup store is ready to perform backup operations.
  - [Create (Task)](/create-task)—This operation creates a schedule of tasks for your deployment that run automatically. Currently, only `CreateBackup` tasks can be created.
  - [Search](/search-logs)—This operation allows you to filter your organization's log for specific log records using supported query types.
  - [Job](/job)—This resource returns the progress and status message of an asynchronous job.
  - [Jobs](/jobs)—This resource is a collection of jobs created within your deployment.

  ## Web adaptors

  [Web adaptor](/web-adaptors) functionality was deferred from the initial release of 10.9. At 10.9.1, web adaptor functionality, and the operations and resources in ArcGIS Enterprise Admin API associated with those functions, are supported.

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

  ## Updated operations and resources

  - A new parameter, `userManagedStores`, has been added to the [Configure](/configure) operation. This parameter supports registering root folder paths for data stores using Network File Sharing. It's recommended that folder paths are registered using the `userManagedStores` parameter, rather than `folderPathsToRegister`.
  - Both the [Configuration (Security)](/security-configuration) and [Update (Security Configuration)](/update-security-configuration) operations support a new property, `allowInternetCORSAccess`. The `allowInternetCORSAccess` property controls the value of the "Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network" response header in a CORS preflight request.
  - A new parameter, `retentionDate`, has been added to the [Create (Backup)](/create-backup) operation. The retention date is the day when the backup will become eligible for cleanup by the `backupRetentionCleaner` task.
  - The [Update (Task)](/edit-task) operation supports updating any scheduled `CreateBackup` and `BackupRetentionCleaner` tasks. This includes support for updating the `passcode` for a backup.
  - The function of the `startTime` and `endTime` parameters for [Query](/query-logs) has been changed at 10.9.1. At 10.9, `startTime` specified the oldest time to query logs against, whereas `endTime` specified the most recent time to query logs against. At 10.9.1, `startTime` and `endTime` mirror their ArcGIS Enterprise counterparts, with `startTime` specifying the most recent time to query logs against and `endTime` specifying the oldest time to query against.

  ## Asynchronous operations

  At 10.9.1, certain operations in ArcGIS Enterprise Admin API support running asynchronously. If run asynchronously, a [job](/job) is created for the request, which can be checked occasionally to monitor progress and view status messages.

  The following operations support the async operation:

  - [Create Service](/create-service)
  - [Edit (Scaling)](/edit-scaling)
  - [Start Service](/start-service)
  - [Stop Service](/stop-service)
  - [Edit (Service)](/edit-service)
  - [Refresh Auto-Deployed Services](/refresh-auto-deployed-services)
  - [Refresh (Deployment)](/refresh-auto-deployed-services)
  - [Edit (Deployment)](/edit-deployment)
  - [Clean](/clean-logs)
  - [Register Item (Data Stores)](/register-data-store-item)

  ## Register data store item

  With ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes 10.9.1, it's recommended that root folder paths being registered for data stores use Network File Sharing (NFS). These folder paths can be registered during [organization configuration](/configure) using the `userManagedStores` parameter. Though it's no longer recommended, support for `folderPathsToRegister`, which was the parameter used at 10.9 to register root folder paths during organization configuration, has not been removed. For more information, see [Register Item (Data Stores)](/register-data-store-item).
