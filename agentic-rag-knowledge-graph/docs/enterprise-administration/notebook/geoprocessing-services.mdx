A geoprocessing service can contain one or more tools that use input data from a client application, process it, and return output in the form of features, maps, reports, files, or services. You can author a notebook using ArcGIS Notebooks and share it as a web tool. A web tool published from ArcGIS Notebooks is shared as an asynchronous geoprocessing service. To publish a webtool from ArcGIS Notebooks, see [Publish a notebook as a webtool](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/notebook/latest/use/windows/publish-a-notebook-as-a-web-tool.htm).

##  Service structure 

A geoprocessing service is a resource that can be accessed through a URL. The URL format for a geoprocessing service is `https:////rest/services//GPServer` , for example: 

```javascript
https://myOrg.esri.com/arcgis/rest/services/ae34f9eacf09447dbfe562a7a6945b17/gpServer
```

 

A geoprocessing service has properties including `Service description` , `Tasks` , and `Execution type` . The geoprocessing tasks that are published in a geoprocessing service are its child resources.

A geoprocessing service does not include operations, but in an asynchronous geoprocessing service, tasks support `submitJob`  and `cancelJob`  operations.

The tasks in a geoprocessing service inherit the `Execution type`  property and include additional properties, such as the task `Description`  and `Parameters` . The properties of the service and the task are determined by the publisher of the service and cannot be modified by the clients. However, a notebook author can edit the notebook and republish the webtool.

## Input and output

Most geoprocessing tasks have both inputs and outputs. There are slight differences between the handling of the input and output of geoprocessing services. 

### Input

For asynchronous geoprocessing services, the input of a task follows the syntax of the data type of a parameter.

### Output

For asynchronous geoprocessing services, the result must be accessed through the `GP Result`  resource after the `submitJob`  operation. The syntax of the result parameters will be based on their data types. 

During the execution of the `submitJob`  operation, the status of the job can be accessed through the `GP Job`  resource.
