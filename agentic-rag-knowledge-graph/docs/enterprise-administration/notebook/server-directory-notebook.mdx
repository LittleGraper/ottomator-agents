## Description

ArcGIS Notebook Server uses server directories to store the user content associated with notebooks. In addition, some directories contain configurations that power the notebooks.

There are four kinds of directories, each of which plays a specific role in server operations: the workspace directory, the data directory, the output directory, and the system directory.

You can [register a local directory as a data directory](/register-server-directory), making it available in ArcGIS Notebooks running in your site.
