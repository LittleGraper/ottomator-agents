## Description

The `healthcheck`  operation verifies that the ArcGIS Notebook Server site has been created and that its Docker environment has been correctly configured. If the health check fails, you cannot communicate with Notebook Server using the web adaptor endpoint. 

<Note type={"note"}>

When upgrading ArcGIS Notebook Server to a new version, the health check will fail until all of the necessary upgrade steps are completed. See [Upgrade ArcGIS Notebook Server](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/notebook/latest/install/windows/upgrade-arcgis-notebook-server.htm) for more information.
