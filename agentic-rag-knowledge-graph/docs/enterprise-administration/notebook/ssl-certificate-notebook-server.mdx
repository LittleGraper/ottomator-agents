## Description

This resource provides information about a particular SSL certificate in your ArcGIS Notebook Server site. A certificate represents a key pair that has been digitally signed and acknowledged by a Certifying Authority (CA). It is the most fundamental component in enabling SSL on your server.

The [Generate Certificate](/generate-certificate-notebook-server) operation creates a new self-signed certificate and adds it to the keystore. In order for browsers and other HTTP client applications to trust the SSL connection on the server, this certificate must be digitally signed by a CA and then [imported into the keystore](/import-ca-signed-certificate-notebook-server). Even though a self-signed certificate can be used with ArcGIS Notebook Server, it is recommended that you use a self-signed certificates only on staging or development servers. 

<Note type={"note"}>

-   By default, the Generate Certificate operation generates a self-signed certificate. Once generated, you can [generate a certificate signing request](/generate-csr-notebook-server) to create a certificate signing request that is then signed by a CA.
-   Typically, certificates are bound to a machine name. Therefore, if the name of the machine changes, you need re-generate the certificate.
