To successfully use the ArcGIS Notebook Server REST API, you must understand how to construct a URL and interpret the response. All resources and operations exposed by the ArcGIS Notebook Server are accessible through a hierarchy of endpoints. A representation of this hierarchy can be observed in the Resource Hierarchy portion of this reference guide. 

## Determine the well-known endpoint

When using the REST API, you must know the well-known endpoint, which represents a server catalog. For ArcGIS Notebook Server, the default endpoint is as follows:

```javascript
https://<host>/<site>/rest/services/<serviceName>/<serviceType>/<serviceLayer>/<operation>
```

 

Where:

-   `host`  is the ArcGIS Notebook Server or web adaptor host name, domain, and top-level domain (.com).

    Example

    ```javascript
    https://myOrg.esri.com
    ```

     
-   `site`  is the site name. The default value is `"arcgis"` . 

    Example

    ```javascript
    https://myOrg.esri.com/arcgis
    ```

     
-   `rest/services`  indicates the REST services endpoint. You'll see a list of all services in the root directory. This part of the URL is case sensitive and should be specified in all lowercase.

    Example

    ```javascript
    https://myOrg.esri.com/arcgis/rest/services
    ```
