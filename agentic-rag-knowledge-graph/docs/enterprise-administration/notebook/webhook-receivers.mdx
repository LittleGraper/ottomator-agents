## Description

The `webhookReceiver` resource provides a comprehensive list of all service webhook receivers registered with ArcGIS Notebook Server. Webhooks, including those for asynchronous geoprocessing services, feature services, or any generic webhook, can initiate a notebook run in response to specific events. This is accomplished by sending a request to the webhook receiver URL:

```other
https://<notebookserver.domain.com>/<notebooks_webcontext>/rest/events/webhooks/<webhook_receiver_id>
```

To ensure security, the webhook event request must include a signature header that was predefined for the webhook receiver. Additionally, it should contain a secret value represented as a Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC), generated using the SHA-256 hashing function and encoded in Base64 format.
