## Description

This resource lists all the certificates (self-signed and CA-signed) created for the server machine. ArcGIS Notebook Server securely stores these certificates inside a keystore within the configuration store.

ArcGIS Notebook Server is capable of [generating self-signed certificates](/generate-certificate-notebook-server) that can be used during development or staging. However, it is critical that you get CA-signed certificates when standing up a production server.

In order to get a certificate signed by a CA, you need to [generate a certificate signing request](/generate-csr-notebook-server) and then submit it to your CA. The CA will sign your certificate request, which can then be imported into the server using the [Import CA-signed Certificate ](/import-ca-signed-certificate-notebook-server)operation.
