## Description

ArcGIS Notebook Server supports publishing a geoprocessing service from a notebook. The `createService`  operation creates a service when a JSON representation of the service is submitted to it. 

To publish a service on Notebook Server, you must be an administrator or a user with Notebook and Publish Web Tools privileges. The notebook must belong to the user publishing the service.

A snapshot of the notebook is automatically created and used for the web tool. If any changes are made to the notebook after publishing a web tool, you must overwrite the web tool for the change to be reflected. 

A notebook-to-web tool relationship is created to maintain the relationship between the notebook and the associated web tool created for the service. This relationship ensures that ownership and sharing permissions are the same for both. When a notebook is deleted, the associated web tool is also deleted.
