## Description

Geoprocessing is a fundamental part of enterprise GIS operations. Geoprocessing provides data analysis, data management, and data conversion tools.

ArcGIS Notebooks allows you to author a notebook and share it as a web tool. A web tool represents an asynchronous geoprocessing service that is executed on ArcGIS Notebook Server. Web tools allow you to share your notebook capabilities with others in your ArcGIS Enterprise portal. A web tool contains a task that uses input data that is either entered in a client application or predefined in the notebook, processes it, and returns output in the form of features, maps, reports, or files.

Only the owner of a notebook can publish that notebook as a web tool, and the publish web tools privilege is required, in addition to notebook privileges. Only one web tool per notebook is allowed.
