## Description

The Data Access Workspace Directory allows you, as a notebook author, to store and read the files used in your notebooks. You, and all other notebook authors in the ArcGIS Enterprise portal, have a unique folder in the workspace directory. Your unique folder is mounted in each of your ArcGIS Notebooks, so the notebook can read and write to the workspace directory. Your notebook can only read and write information in your workspace directory folder, and your workspace directory folder cannot be accessed by other folders.

The Data Access APIs allow you to manage the files in your directory.
