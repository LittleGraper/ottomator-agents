## Description

Starting at 10.7.1, ArcGIS Notebook Server provides this operation to restore a site configuration from a backup. The backup will have been created and exported by the [exportSite](/export-site-notebook-server) operation as a ZIP file with the `.agssite`  file extension.

Performing this operation will overwrite the current contents of your ArcGIS Notebook Server site's configuration store with the contents from the backup. You can use it to restore a site configuration in the event of machine failure or human error.

The import operation may take a while to complete. When you execute the operation, keep the tab open on your browser until the operation completes, as a report will be delivered to the page.

<Note type={"note"}>

The site does not keep a copy of the report after the operation completes; if you navigate away from the page before then, you will not be able to view the report confirming that the operation was successful.
