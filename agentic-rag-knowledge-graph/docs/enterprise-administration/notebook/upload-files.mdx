## Description

The `uploadFile`  operation allows uploads a single file to your workspace directory (`/arcgis/home` ). By default, the file is uploaded to the root of the workspace directory. You can prefix a directory path to the file name to upload the file to a subdirectory. 

The upload file size limit is 128 MB for a single file. Large files can also be uploaded in parts from a client that has the ability to split files into smaller parts. To initiate a multipart upload, the client passes in the `isMultipart=true`  parameter to the `uploadFile`  operation, along with the `fileName`  and `blockId` . After uploading all parts, the operation can be completed by passing in the `xmlField`  along with `fileName`  and `isMultipart=true` .

<Note type>

The `Transfer User Workspace` resource can also be accessed by the `/dataaccess/uploadFile` endpoint. 

</Note>


##  Request parameters

<StyledTable headers={"Parameter,Details"}>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`fileName` 

(Required)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Defines the name of the file to be uploaded. Optionally, the file can be uploaded to a subdirectory by prefixing a folder path to the file name.

If you upload a file using a `fileName`  value that was used previously, the previously uploaded file is overwritten.

Examples

```javascript
//Example 1: Upload a file to the root directory in the user's workspace
fileName=mjwaterzip

//Example 2: Upload a file to a subdirectory () in the user's workspace
fileName=hydrology/mjwaterzip

//Example 3: Upload a file to a nested subdirectory in the user's workspace
fileName=hydrology/2020/mjwaterzip

```

Values: `true`  \| `false` 

</StyledTableCell>

</StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableRow>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`blockId` 

(Optional)

</StyledTableCell>

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

Required when uploading files in multiple parts. `blockId`  can be either a number or an alphanumeric string. A `blockId`  value uniquely identifies a part and defines its position in the object being created. If you upload a file using a `blockId`  value that has been used previously, the previously uploaded part will be overwritten. 

Examples

```javascript
blockId=0

blockId=a0

```

<StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

`xmlField`

blockId = 1
x-ms-blob-type = BlockBlob
f = json
```

 

#### Request 3: Complete upload

```javascript
https://notebookserver.domain.com/context/admin/dataaccess/notebookworkspace/uploadFile
