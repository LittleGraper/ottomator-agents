## Description

This operation allows you to change the location of a server directory for your ArcGIS Notebook Server site.

This operation is mostly used when growing a single-machine site to a multiple-machine configuration, which requires that the server directories and configuration store be put on a network-accessible file share. When you are doing so, you must perform this operation to move each directory in turn.

When you change the location of a directory, copy and paste the contents of the existing directory into the new directory. This ensures that no content is lost after the move.

If you edit the location of the `workspace`  directory, all containers running in the site will be terminated. Ensure that your users are not currently executing notebooks and have saved their work before you run this operation. After the operation is complete, each user will launch a new container the next time they open or create a notebook. This only applies when the `workspace`  directory is edited.
