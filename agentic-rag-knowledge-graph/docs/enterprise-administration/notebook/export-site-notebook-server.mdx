## Description

Starting at 10.7.1, ArcGIS Notebook Server provides this operation to back up the site's configuration store, along with the [importSite](/import-site-notebook-server) operation to restore a site configuration from a backup. The configuration store hosts essential information about the ArcGIS Notebook Server site and its machines.

The output of this operation is a ZIP file with the `.agssite`  file extension.

There are many items and directories that are not backed up by this operation. Among them:

-   Notebooks
-   Container settings
-   Jobs directory

If desired, you can create your own file system backups for these items.
