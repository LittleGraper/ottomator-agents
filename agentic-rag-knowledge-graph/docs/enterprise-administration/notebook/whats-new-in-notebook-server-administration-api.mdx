###  New Notebook Server REST Services API Operations and Resources

-   [Geoprocessing services](/geoprocessing-services) support multiple [data types](/geoprocessing-services-data-types) and can contain one or more tools that use input data from a client application, process it, and return output in the form of features, maps, reports, files, or services. You can author a notebook using ArcGIS Notebooks and share it as a web tool. A web tool published from ArcGIS Notebooks is shared as an asynchronous geoprocessing service.

    -   The [GP Service](/gp-service) resource represents a geoprocessing service published using ArcGIS Notebook Server and provides information about the service.
    -   The [GP task](/gp-task) resource represents a single task in a geoprocessing service published using ArcGIS Notebook Server and provides information about the task.
    -   The [GP job](/gp-job) resource represents a job submitted using the [submitJob](/submit-gp-job) operation and provides information about the job.
    -   The [Submit GP Job](/submit-gp-job) operation is performed on an asynchronous GP task resource and results in a GP job resource. 
    -   The [Cancel GP Job](/cancel-gp-job) operation is performed on an asynchronous GP job resource and results in the cancellation of a geoprocessing job.
    -   The [GP results](/gp-result) resource represents a result parameter for a GP job and provides information about the result parameter, such as its name, data type, and value.
    -   The [GP inputs](/gp-input) resource represents an input parameter for a GP job and provides information about the input parameter such as its name, data type, and value.

##  10.9 

The sign-in page for the ArcGIS Notebook Server Administrator Directory now supports an improved experience for signing in using your portal user account.

###  New Operations and Resources

-   ArcGIS Notebooks Snapshots allow ArcGIS Notebooks authors to preserve up to five (configurable) point-in-time, full snapshots of a Notebook. 

    -   The [Create Snapshot](/create-snapshot) operation allows you to create a point-in-time, full snapshot of a notebook.
    -   The [List Snapshots](/list-snapshots) operation allows you to list all snapshots associated with a notebook item.
    -   The [Delete Snapshot](/delete-snapshot) operation allows the owner of a notebook to delete one or more snapshots associated with that notebook item.
    -   The [Restore Snapshot](/restore-snapshot) operation allows for the restoring of a notebook snapshot for that notebook item.
    -   The [Download Notebook Snapshot](/download-snapshot) operation allows for the downloading of a notebook snapshot. The snapshot is returned as a JSON representation of the notebook.
    -   The [Convert Snapshot to a Notebook](/convert-snapshot-to-a-notebook) operation allows the owner of a notebook to convert a snapshot to a new notebook item.
-   The ArcGIS Notebooks Data Access API allows a user to manage the files in their respective directory.

    -   The [List Files](/list-files) resource lists files that are located in the workspace directory (/arcgis/home) of the user making the request.
    -   The [Upload File](/upload-files) operation allows uploading a single file to the workspace directory (/arcgis/home) of the user making the request. Large files (larger than 256 MB), can also be uploaded in parts from a client that has the ability to split files into smaller parts.
    -   The [Download File](/download-file) resource allows a user to download a file from their notebook workspace directory (/arcgis/home).
    -   The [Delete File](/delete-files) operation allows a user to permanently remove a file from their notebook workspace directory (/arcgis/home). 
-   New container resources and operations:

    -   The [container notebooks](/container-notebooks) resource provides a list of all notebooks currently open in the container.
    -   The [container notebook](/container-notebook) resource provides a description of a specific notebook's properties.
    -   The [close container notebook](/close-container-notebook) operation stops a running notebook. 
-   The [`deleteAll` ](/delete-all-jobs) jobs operation will delete all completed or failed `openNotebook`  or `executeNotebook`  jobs.

### Updated Operations and Resources

-   The [register runtime](/register-runtime) operation no longer supports `version`  as an input. A runtime version will be automatically assigned based on the version of the notebook server.
-   The [licenses](/licenses) resource now allows you to return license information for each machine in a site with the `byMachine`  parameter. This support was added to allow the viewing of licenses applied to individual machines in a multi-licensed site.
