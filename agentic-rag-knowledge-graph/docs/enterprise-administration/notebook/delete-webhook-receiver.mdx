## Description

The delete webhook receiver operation allows administrators to remove a registered service webhook receiver from ArcGIS Notebook Server. It is important to note that any associated webhooks, such as those linked to asynchronous geoprocessing services, feature services, or any generic webhooks, must be updated to eliminate references to this specific webhook receiver.
