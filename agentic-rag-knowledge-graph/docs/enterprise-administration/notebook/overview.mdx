The ArcGIS Notebook Server Administrator Directory allows site administrators to perform administrative tasks and view information about their site using ArcGIS REST API. 

The Administrator Directory can be accessed directly in a browser, or programmatically using any framework that can make HTTP requests.

The API is organized into resources and operations. Resources are objects within ArcGIS Notebook Server that hold some information and a have well-defined state. Operations act on these resources and update their information or state. Resources and operations are hierarchical and have unique URLs.

## Get started

The hierarchical root of the Administrator API begins with a well-defined URL that is called as the site URL. Typically, this is accessible at `https://notebookserver.domain.com:11443/arcgis/admin`  or `https://notebookserverwebadaptor.domain.com/webadaptor/admin` .

The various resources and operations that are exposed by the Administrator API are organized hierarchically from the site URL. To programmatically access a resource or invoke an operation, you must create a request by doing the following:

1.  Construct a URL to the selected resource or operation as defined in the API Reference.
2.  Provide the relevant parameters in their specified format.
3.  Access the URL over the prescribed HTTP method (typically GET or POST).

<Note type={"note"}>

Users not directly interacting with administrative or REST APIs (for example, using scripts or having a web application firewall configured) may encounter query limitations. In instances where a query string exceeds 2048 characters in length, the query should be submitted as a POST request.

</Note>

The API is stateless, which means that the server does not keep track of transactions from one request to the next. Each request must contain all the necessary information for successful processing. The server will process each request and return a well-defined response.

## Directory interface

The ArcGIS Notebook Server Administrator Directory HTML interface allows you to interact with the resources and operations exposed by the Administrator API. This can be helpful when building scripts for administrative tasks and applications. The Administrator Directory is accessible by browsing to the site URL in a web browser.
