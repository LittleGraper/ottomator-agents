## Description

This resource lists all the [certificates](/machines-machine-ssl-certificates-ssl-cert) (self-signed and CA-signed) created for the server machine. The server securely stores these certificates inside a key store within the [configuration store](/systems-configuration-store). 

Before you enable SSL on your server, you need to [generate](/machines-machine-ssl-certificates-generate-certificate) certificates and get them signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). For your convenience, the server is capable of generating self-signed certificates that can be used during development or staging. However, it is critical that you get CA-signed certificates when standing up a production server. In order to get a certificate signed by a CA, you need to [generate a CSR](/machines-machine-ssl-certificates-ssl-cert-generate-csr) (certificate signing request) and then submit it to your CA. The CA will sign your certificate request which can then be imported into the server by using the [import CA signed certificate](/machines-machine-ssl-certificates-ssl-cert-importsignedcert) operation.
