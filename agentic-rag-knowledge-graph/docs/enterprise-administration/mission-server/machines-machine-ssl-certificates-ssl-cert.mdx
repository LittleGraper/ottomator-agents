## Description

A certificate represents a key pair that has been digitally signed and acknowledged by a Certifying Authority (CA). It is the most fundamental component in enabling SSL on your server. This resource returns information on an individual certificate. New self-signed certificates created by the [Generate Certificate ](/machines-machine-ssl-certificates-generate-certificate) operation are added to the keystore. In order for browsers and other HTTP client applications to trust the SSL connection on the server, these certificates must be digitally signed by a CA and then imported into the keystore.

<Note type={"note"}>

Typically, certificates are bound to a machine name. Therefore, if the name of the machine changes, you need re-generate the certificate.

</Note>

This resource provides information on an individual certificate, as well as provide access to a [Export ](/machines-machine-ssl-certificates-ssl-cert-export-cert), [Delete ](/machines-machine-ssl-certificates-ssl-cert-delete-cert), [ Generate CSR](/machines-machine-ssl-certificates-ssl-cert-generate-csr), and [Import Signed Certificate ](/machines-machine-ssl-certificates-ssl-cert-importsignedcert) operations.

<Note type={"note"}>

Even though a self-signed certificate can be used to enable SSL, it is recommended that you use a self-signed certificate only on staging or development servers.
