## Description

A site is a collection of server resources. This collection includes server machines that are installed with  ArcGIS Mission Server, data, and so on. The site resource also lists the current version of the software. 

When you install  ArcGIS Mission Server on a server machine for the first time, you must [create a new site](/create-site). Once a site is no longer required, you can [delete](/delete-site) the site, which will cause all of the resources to be cleaned up.

The site maintains all its configuration and meta information on disk in a set of files that make up the [Configuration Store.](/systems-configuration-store)
