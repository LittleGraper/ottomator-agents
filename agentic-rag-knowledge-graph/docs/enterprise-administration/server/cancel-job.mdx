## Description

The `cancel` operation cancels the asynchronous job being run by the geoprocessing service. The operation can only succeed if the current status of the job is `SUBMITTED` or `EXECUTING`. If the job currently carries a different status, an error of **Unable to cancel job** will be returned. The `cancel` operation does not remove any information about the job from the service. To cancel a job and remove information about the job from the service, use the [Delete Job](/delete-job) operation.

<Note type="tip">

The [Cancel GP Job](DEVSITE//rest/services-reference/enterprise/cancel-gp-job/) operation in the ArcGIS Server Services Directory performs the same function as this operation.
