## Description

The `delete` operation deletes the specified asynchronous job being run by the geoprocessing service. If the current status of the job is `SUBMITTED` or `EXECUTING`, it will cancel the job. Regardless of status, the `delete` operation removes all information about the job from the system. To cancel a job in progress without removing information, use the [Cancel Job](/cancel-job) operation.
