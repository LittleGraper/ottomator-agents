## Description

The resource for an individual certificate returns information for a specific certificate. It also provides access to the [Export](/exportcertificate), [Delete](/deletecertificate), [Import Signed Certificate](/importsignedcertificate), and [Generate CSR](/generatecsr) operations.

A certificate represents a key pair that has been digitally signed and acknowledged by a certificate authority (CA). It is a fundamental component in enabling SSL on a server. This resource returns information about an individual certificate. New self-signed certificates created by the [`generate` ](/generatecertificate) certificate operation are added to the keystore. For browsers and other HTTP client applications to trust the SSL connection on the server, these certificates must be digitally signed by a CA and imported into the keystore. Even though a self-signed certificate can be used to enable SSL, it is recommended that you use a self-signed certificate on staging and development servers.

<Note type={"note"}>

Typically, certificates are associated with a machine name. If the name of the machine changes, the certificate must be regenerated.
