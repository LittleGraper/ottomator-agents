## Description

The `clean` operation cleans the content (files and folders) within the directory that have passed their expiration date. Every server directory has the `maxFileAge` and `cleanupMode` properties that govern when a file created inside is supposed to be cleaned up. The server directory cleaner automatically cleans up the content within server directories at regular intervals. However, you can explicitly clean the directory by invoking this operation.
