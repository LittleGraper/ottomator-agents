## Description

The `federate` operation imports any services that you have previously published to your server site and makes them available as items within the organization you are federating the server with. Services are imported automatically as part of the federate process.

<Note type={"note"}>

The `federate` operation does not affect any items representing services published by portal users (in other words, services in the **Hosted** folder on ArcGIS Server). Those services are entirely managed by the portal.

</Note>

If the automatic import of services fails as part of the federation process, the following severe-level message will appear in the server logs:

```markdown
Failed to import GIS services as items within portal.
```

If this failure occurs, you can manually re-run the operation to import your services as items in the portal. Before you do this, obtain a portal token and then validate ArcGIS Server is federated with the organization.

After you run the `Federate` operation, specify sharing properties to determine which users and groups will be able to access each service.
