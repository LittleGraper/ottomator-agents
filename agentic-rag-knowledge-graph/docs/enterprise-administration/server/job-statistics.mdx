## Description

The `statistics` operation provides counts for the current number of asynchronous jobs for the geoprocessing service, as well as counts of those currently carrying the status of `FAILED`, `SUCCEEDED`, and `CANCELLED`. Jobs that have failed or succeeded will remain in the system until the server's jobs directory clears them out according to its [user-defined cleanup interval](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/administer/windows/about-server-directories.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_0C376D8229F445039D0E475E2A2A23DF).
