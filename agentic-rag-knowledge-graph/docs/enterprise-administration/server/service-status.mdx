## Description

The `status` resource provides the configured and real-time status of a [GIS service](/service). 

The configured status represents the state of a resource as it is configured. For example, starting a GIS service sets its configured status to `STARTED`. The status is persisted to the [configuration store](/configstore).

However, the configured status may not match the actual state of a resource. The real-time status represents the actual state of a resource. The real-time status information is collected when the request is made, and it is not persisted. For most purposes, the real-time status should be used.
