## Description

The `platformservices` resource allows you to view and manage your platform services in the ArcGIS Server Administrator Directory. The [Compute Platform](/compute-platform) and [Synchronization](/synchronization-service) services are used by GeoAnalytics Server. For each platform service, you can start it, stop it, and view its status. While a health check operation is exposed for all three platform services, only [Compute Platform Health Check](/compute-platform-health-check) returns valuable information.

<Note type="legacy">

    The ArcGIS GeoAnalytics Server extension is
    [deprecated](https://support.esri.com/en-us/knowledge-base/deprecation-arcgis-geoanalytics-server-000032771)
    with the release of ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4. The last ArcGIS Enterprise release with support for GeoAnalytics Server
    is 11.3.
