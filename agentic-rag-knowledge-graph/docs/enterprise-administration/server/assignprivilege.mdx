## Description

The `assignPrivilege` operation assigns a privilege to a role.

Administrative access to ArcGIS Server is modeled as three broad tiers of privileges: 

- `ADMINISTER`—A role that possesses this privilege has unrestricted administrative access to ArcGIS Server. 
- `PUBLISH`—A role that possesses this privilege can only publish GIS services to ArcGIS Server. 
- `ACCESS`—No administrative access. A role with this privilege can only be granted permission to access one or more GIS services. 

By assigning these privileges to one or more roles in the role store, the ArcGIS Server security model supports role-based access control to its administrative functionality. These privilege assignments are stored independent of the ArcGIS Server role store. As a result, you don't need to update your enterprise identity stores (like Active Directory).

<Note type={"note"}>

By default, a role in the role store does not have any administrative privileges (in other words, it has `ACCESS` level).
