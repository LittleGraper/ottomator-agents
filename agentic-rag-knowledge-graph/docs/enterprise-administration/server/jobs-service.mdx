## Description

The `jobs` resource provides access tp operations that locate, monitor, and intervene in current asynchronous jobs being run by a geoprocessing service.

From the `jobs` resource, you can [query](/query-jobs) for jobs that meet specific conditions, [purge the queue](/purge-job-queue) of all jobs with a current status of `NEW`, `SUBMITTED`, or `WAITING`, and [view statistics](/job-statistics) of the current jobs for the service.

After a job has been completed, either failing or succeeding, it remains in the system until the server's jobs directory clears it out according to its [user-defined cleanup interval](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/administer/windows/about-server-directories.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_0C376D8229F445039D0E475E2A2A23DF).
