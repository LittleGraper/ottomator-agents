## Description

The resource for an individual web adaptor returns the properties of that web adaptor, such as the HTTP and HTTPS ports and description.

The Web Adaptor is a web application that runs in a front-end web server. One of the Web Adaptor's primary responsibilities is to forward HTTP requests from end users to the back-end GIS Server in a round-robin fashion. The Web Adaptor acts a reverse proxy, providing the end users with an entry point into the system, hiding the GIS servers, and providing some degree of immunity from back-end failures.

The front-end web server could authenticate incoming requests against your enterprise identity stores and provide specific authentication schemes like Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA), HTTP Basic or Digest.

Most importantly, a Web Adaptor provides your end users with a well-defined entry point into your system without exposing the internal details of your GIS server. The back-end GIS server will trust requests being forwarded by one or more of such registered Web Adaptors and will not challenge the user for any credentials. However, the authorization of the request (by looking up roles and permissions) is still enforced by the GIS server.
