    ## Register a cloud-provided object store

    Starting at ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4, a base deployment of ArcGIS Enterprise includes an object store. The object store can either be an ArcGIS Data Store object store or, if ArcGIS Enterprise is being deployed using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure cloud, the organization can [register a cloud-provided object store](/registerdataitem/) using either Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) or Azure Blob Storage. An organization's object store will hold the caches for hosted scene layers, the caches for hosted 3D tile layers, and the cached query responses for hosted feature layers. An ArcGIS Data Store object store also supports storing videos for the ArcGIS Video Server site. A cloud-provided object store does not support storing ArcGIS Video Server videos.

    The following documentation has been udpated to include object store information:

    - [Data Item](/dataitem)
    - [Register Data Item](/registerdataitem)
    - [Unregister Data Item](/unregisterdataitem)

      ## GeoAnalytics Server retirement

      GeoAnalytics Server has been retired with the release of ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4. Organizations upgrading to version 11.4 or later will no longer be able to register a Big Data File Share. Organizations upgrading to versions 11.4 or higher will need to delete their Big Data File Share items. For more information, see the [ArcGIS GeoAnalytics Server retirement](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/deploy/linux/upgrade-arcgis-server-windows-and-linux.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_0034E17F41AD4AACA90622F772D800BE) section in the Upgrade ArcGIS Server documentation.

    - The [Server Properties](/serverproperties) and [Update Server Properties](/updateserverproperties) endpoints have been updated to support a new property, `diskSpaceThresholdGB`. The `diskSpaceThresholdGB` property specifies the threshold of usable disk space.
    - The [Import Existing Server Certificate](/importexistingservercertificate) operation has been updated to include the `importCertificateChain` parameter. The `importCertificateChain` parameter specifies if the operation should also import the root or intermediate certificates included inside the certificate file.
    - A new event trigger, `FeaturesPosted`, has been added for feature service webooks. The [Create](/create-webhook) or [Edit](/edit-webhook) operations can be used to include this event trigger for feature service webhooks.
      <Note>

      To schedule a webhook using this event trigger, the feature service must have the [Version Management capability enabled](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/geodatabases/overview/publish-branch-versioned-data.htm). For more information, see the [Create webhooks](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/create-webhooks.htm) documentation.

      </Note>
    - The [Import Site](/importsite) operation has been updated to support a new parameter, `restartWebServer`. This parameter specifies whether the server should restart once the operation completes.

      Support for feature service and geoprocessing service webhooks has been added to the ArcGIS Server Admin API at ArcGIS Enterprise 11.1. Feature service webhooks allow administrators to subscribe to event triggers pertaining to a feature service in their organization. Though geoprocessing services do not have specific event triggers that administrators can subscribe to, geoprocessing service webhooks will be invoked when a geoprocessing service job is completed. The following documentation has been added to this publication to serve as references for the service webhook endpoints:

      -   [Webhooks](/webhooks)
      -   [Create (Webhooks)](/create-webhook)
      -   [Delete All](/delete-all-webhooks)
      -   [Deactivate All](/deactivate-all-webhooks)
      -   [Activate All](/activate-all-webhooks)
      -   [Webhook](/webhook)
      -   [Edit (Webhook)](/edit-webhook)
      -   [Delete (Webhook)](/delete-webhook)


      [Lifecycle Information](/lifecycle-info) returns the date and time information (in Unix epoch format) of when a data store item was created and updated.
    
    </Tab>

    <Tab>

      - Two new properties, `validFromEpoch` and `validUntilEpoch`, have been added to the response of the [SSL Certificate](/certificate) resource. The `validFromEpoch` property shows the date and time information (in Unix epoch format) for when a certificate's validity begins, and the `validUntilEpoch` property shows the date and time information (in Unix epoch format) for when a certificate's validity ends.
      - The [Export Site](/exportsite) operation supports the `validate` parameter. The `validate` parameter ensures that the folder path where the exported content will be written is accessible to ArcGIS Server before performing the operation.
      - The [Import Site](/importsite) operation supports the `validate` parameter. The `validate` parameter ensures that the folder path where the exported site configuration is located is accessible to ArcGIS Server before performing the operation.

      At this release, ArcGIS Server no longer supports the ArcMap runtime or publishing services from ArcMap. After upgrading to ArcGIS Enterprise 11.0 or later, any remaining geocode or geoprocessing services that were originally published from ArcMap cannot be started and [must be republished from ArcGIS Enterprise](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/publish-services/windows/migrating-services-to-the-arcgis-pro-service-runtime.htm). Starting from ArcGIS Enterprise 11.0, services must be created using the ArcGIS Pro service runtime and the `ArcObjects11` provider.

      - The new [security configuration property](/securityconfig), `allowInternetCORSAccess`, controls the value of the "Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network" response header in a CORS preflight request to a REST service URL.
      - Two new [system properties](/serverproperties) have been added: `maxHttpPostSizeInBytes` and `webServerMaxRequestThreads`. The `maxHttpPostSizeInBytes` property allows users to change the maximum size in bytes for POST requests sent to ArcGIS Server. The `webServerMaxRequestThreads` property allows users to change the maximum number of threads that are available at one time to process requests sent to ArcGIS Server.

      The Python Software Foundation has ended support for the Python 2 programming language, impacting the ArcMap service runtime that uses Python 2.x. At 10.9.1, when installing ArcGIS Server, you will have the option to disable the ArcMap service runtime, removing Python 2.x from your deployment. Disabling the ArcMap runtime will impact the following operations and resources in the ArcGIS Server Admin API:

      - [Start Service](/startservice)—If the ArcMap runtime is disabled, services with ArcMap (`ArcObjects`) as their service provider will be stopped. Attempting to start these services will result in an error.
      - [Create Service](/createservice)—Creating a service with ArcMap (`ArcObjects`) as the service provider when the ArcMap runtime is disabled will result in an error.
      - [Register Extension](/registerextension)—Registering ArcMap-based SOE items to your organization when the ArcMap runtime is disabled will result in an error.
      - [Join Site](/joinsite)—ArcGIS Server sites will be able to successfully run the `joinSite` operation if the joining machine has a matching status for the ArcMap runtime to that of the existing server site. If the joining machine has a conflicting ArcMap runtime status, attempting the `joinSite` operation will result in an error message.
      - [Register Machine](/registermachine)—If the server machine being registered with the ArcGIS Server site has a conflicting ArcMap runtime status, attempting to register the machine will result in an error message.
      - [Providers](/providers)—This resource now returns a list of enabled providers, indicating whether both the ArcMap (`ArcObjects`) and ArcGIS Pro (`ArcObjects11`) runtimes are enabled, or only the ArcGIS Pro runtime is enabled.
      - [Change Provider](/change-provider)—This operation now supports changing the provider type of ArcMap services (`ArcObjects`) to ArcGIS Pro (`ArcObjects11`), migrating these services from the ArcMap service runtime to the ArcGIS Pro service runtime.

      <Note type={"note"}>

      After 10.9.1, ArcGIS Server will no longer support the ArcMap runtime. It is recommended that you begin to prepare for this deprecation by migrating, republishing, or removing all services that use the ArcMap service runtime in your organization. For more information about migrating services, see [Migrate a service in Server Manager](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/11.0/publish-services/windows/migrate-a-service-in-manager.htm) and [Migrating services to the ArcGIS Pro service runtime](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/publish-services/windows/migrating-services-to-the-arcgis-pro-service-runtime.htm).

      Starting with Insights 2021.1, the registration and management of relational data store types should be performed with ArcGIS Insights. For more information, see [Manage connector types](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/insights/2023.2/administer/manage-connector-types.htm).

      - The [Register Relational Data Store Type](/register-relational-data-store-type) operation was introduced at 10.5 and allowed the user to register a new relational data store type with the server.
      - The [Edit Relational Data Store Type](/edit-relational-data-store-type) operation was introduced at 10.5 and allowed the user to edit a registered relational data store type to update its properties.
      - The [Relational Data Store Type](/relational-datastore-type) resource was introduced at 10.5 and returned a list of the properties for a registered relational data store type.
      - The [Relational Data Store Types](/relational-data-store-types) resource was introduced at 10.5 and returned a list of the relational data store types that were registered with the server.
      - The [Unregister Relational Data Store Types](/unregister-relational-data-store-type) operation was introduced at 10.5 and allowed the user to unregister a relational data store type from the server.

      [Edit Service](/editservice) now supports the ability to specify if a service's virtual directories are secured and require authentication. This is associated with the site-wide property that can be set through the [Update Security Configuration](/updatesecurityconfig) operation.

      ### Privilege-based access

      [Access to the Server Admin API](/managing-access-to-the-server-administration-rest-api) is based off the privileges included in either a user's custom or default role, enabling administrators to restrict or grant access to the resources and operations that are associated with, and required by, their assigned privileges. At 10.8, this functionality was first introduced through changes made to administrator access to the Portal Admin API directory. At 10.8.1, this same privilege-based system has been implemented for the ArcGIS Server Admin API directory.
