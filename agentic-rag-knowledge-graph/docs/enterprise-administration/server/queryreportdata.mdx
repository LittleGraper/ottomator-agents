## Description

The `data` operation retrieves server usage data for the report. This operation aggregates and filters server usage statistics for the entire ArcGIS Server site. The report data is aggregated in a time slice, which is obtained by dividing up the time duration by the default (or specified) `aggregationInterval` parameter in the report. Each time slice is represented by a timestamp, which represents the ending period of that time slice.

In the JSON response, the queried data is returned for each metric-resource URI combination in a query. In the report-data section, the queried data is represented as an array of numerical values. A response of `null` indicates that data is not available or requests were not logged for that metric in the corresponding time-slice.


##  Request parameters

<StyledTable headers={"Parameter,Description"}>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      `filter` 

    </StyledTableCell>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      The report data can be filtered by the machine where the data is generated. The filter accepts a comma separated list of machine names; `*` represents all machines.

      ```markdown label=Example
      // filters for the specified machines
      {"machines": ["WIN-85VQ4T2LR5N", "WIN-239486728937"]}

      // no filtering; all machines are accepted
      {"machines": "*"} 
      ```

    </StyledTableCell>
  </StyledTableRow>
  <StyledTableRow>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      `f` 

    </StyledTableCell>
    <StyledTableCell cellStyle="markdown">

      The response format. The default response format is `html`.

      Values: `html` | `json` | `csv` | `pjson`

    </StyledTableCell>
  </StyledTableRow>
</StyledTable>


## Example usage

The following is a sample GET request for the `data` operation:

```markdown
https://machine.domain.com/webadaptor/admin/usagereports/1394810360738/data?filter={"machines":"*"}&f=pjson
```

 

## JSON Response example
