## Description

The `publicKey` resource returns the server's public key, which can be used by client applications (or scripts) to encrypt data sent to the server using the RSA algorithm for public-key encryption. In addition to encrypting the sensitive parameters, the client is also required to send to the server an additional flag encrypted with value set to true. As the public key for the server can be changed at a later time, the client must fetch it on each request before encrypting the data sent to the server.

<Note type={"caution"}>

You should not encrypt the values for the response format (`f`) or the `token` parameter.
