## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

Clusters have been deprecated. The use of clusters for new deployments is strongly discouraged and existing deployments are advised to migrate away from use of clusters as part of ongoing maintenance and upgrades.

</Note>

The clustering protocol defines a channel which is used by server machines within a cluster to communicate with each other. A server machine will communicate with its peers information about the status of objects running within it for load balancing and fault tolerance. 

ArcGIS Server supports the TCP clustering protocols where server machines communicate with each other over a TCP channel (port).
