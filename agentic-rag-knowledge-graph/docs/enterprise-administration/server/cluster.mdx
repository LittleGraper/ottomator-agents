## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

Clusters have been deprecated. The use of clusters for new deployments is strongly discouraged and existing deployments are advised to migrate away from use of clusters as part of ongoing maintenance and upgrades.

</Note>

This resource returns the properties of an individual cluster.

A Cluster is a group of [ server machines](/machine) that host a collection of GIS [ services](/service). Grouping server machines into a cluster allows you to treat them as a single unit to which you can publish GIS services. A cluster with more than one server machine provides a level of fault tolerance to the services. At the same time, having more than one machine increases the computing power of your cluster, hence increasing the overall throughput. A cluster is dynamic with respect to the list of server machines. New server machines can be [ added](/addmachines) to increase computing power without affecting the already running GIS services. You can also [ remove](/removemachines) machines from a cluster and re-assign them to another cluster.
