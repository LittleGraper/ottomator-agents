## Description

The `disable` operation disables login privileges for the primary site administrator account. This operation can only be invoked by an administrator in the system. To re-enable this account, use the [Enable Primary Site Administrator](/enablepsa) operation.

<Note type={"caution"}>

Once disabled, you cannot use the primary site administrator account to log into Manager. Therefore, you should disable this account only if you have other administrators in the system. If you are currently logged into the Administrator Directory using the primary site administrator account, you will need to log back in with another administrative account.

</Note>
