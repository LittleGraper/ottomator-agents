## Description

The `settings` resource returns the current usage reports settings. The usage reports settings are applied to the entire site. When usage reports are enabled, service usage statistics are collected and persisted to a statistics database. When usage reports are disabled, the statistics are not collected. The `samplingInterval` parameter defines the duration (in minutes) during which the usage statistics are sampled and collected (in-memory) before being written out to the statistics database. Database entries are deleted after the interval specified in the `maxHistory` parameter (in days), unless the `maxHistory` parameter is 0, for which the statistics are persisted forever.
