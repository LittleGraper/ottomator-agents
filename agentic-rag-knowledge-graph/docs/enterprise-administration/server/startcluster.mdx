## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

Clusters have been deprecated. The use of clusters for new deployments is strongly discouraged and existing deployments are advised to migrate away from use of clusters as part of ongoing maintenance and upgrades.

</Note>

This operation starts the cluster. Starting a cluster involves starting all the server machines within the cluster and the GIS services that are deployed to the cluster. This operation attempts to start all the server machines. If one or more of them cannot be reached, this operation reports an error.
