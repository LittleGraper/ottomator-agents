## Description

The `synchronizeWithSite` operation synchornizes specific machines with the site, reconfiguring the machine and redeploying services.

On occasion, one or more machines in a server site might be unavailable due to network issues or because they are down (intentionally or unintentionally). Once these machines become available again, they will need to synchronize with the site to pick up any changes made to the site during that downtime. This is done automatically by the site, but it is only a one-time attempt. If there are any issues with this synchronizing effort, a **SEVERE** message is logged. In that event, administrators can perform the `synchronizeWithSite` operation to manually synchronize the machine.

This process will take a few minutes. During this time, all administrative operations on the site will be blocked.
