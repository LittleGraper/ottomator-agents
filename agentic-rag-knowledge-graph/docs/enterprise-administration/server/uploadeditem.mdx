## Description

The individual item resource represents an item that has been uploaded to the server. Various workflows upload items and then process them on the server. For example, when publishing a GIS service from ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Server Manager, the application first uploads the service definition (`.sd`) to the server and then invokes the publishing geoprocessing tool to publish the service. 

Each uploaded item is identified by a unique name (`itemID`). The `pathOnServer` property locates the specific item in the ArcGIS Server system directory. The `committed` parameter is set to true once the upload of individual parts is complete.

<Note type={"note"}>

If the uploaded item is not made up of any parts, the parts list is empty.
