## Description

The `status` resource provides the configured and current status of a [server machine](/machine). 

The configured status represents the state of the resource as you have configured it to be. For example, starting a server machine would set its configured status to be `STARTED`. The status is persisted to the [configuration store](/configstore).

However, it is possible that the configured state may not match the actual state of the resource. The real-time status represents the actual state of a resource. For instance, consider that you have configured the server machine to be `STARTED` but the machine was abruptly powered off. In this case, its real-time status would be `STOPPED`. The real-time status information is harvested when the request is made, and it is not persisted.

For most purposes, the real-time status should be used.
