## Description

The `recover` operation can be used to recover a site if the shared server directories are permanently lost. If the shared server directories for a site are unavailable, a site in read-only mode will operate in a degraded capacity that allows access to the ArcGIS Server Administrator Directory. To perform this operation, the site must be in read-only mode and the site configuration files must have been copied to the local repository when switching site modes. The `recover` operation will copy the server directories from the local repository into the shared server directories location. The copied local repository will be from the machine in the site where the `recover` operation is performed.
