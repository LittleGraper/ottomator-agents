Some services support extensions that enhance their capabilities. Each extension is composed of a set of properties that are defined for the extension type. You can enable an extension on a service by submitting a JSON representation of its configuration as part of the service definition in the [ Create Service](/createservice) operation. 

The supported out-of-the-box extension types are as follows:

-   [KmlServer](/extensiontypes#kmlserver)—SingleImage, SeparateImages, Vectors
-   [FeatureServer](/extensiontypes#featureserver)—Query, Editing
-   [NAServer](/extensiontypes#naserver)
-   [WCSServer](/extensiontypes#wcsserver)
-   [WFSServer](/extensiontypes#wfsserver)
-   [WMSServer](/extensiontypes#wmsserver)
-   [JPIPServer](/extensiontypes#jpipserver)

<Note type={"note"}>

The following property sets must be passed in as the value of the `properties`  parameter in the JSON representation of the service. 

</Note>

##  KmlServer 

```javascript
{ 
	"dpi" : "", 
	"imageSize" : "" ,
	"linkDescription" : "" ,
	"linkName" : "" ,

        // If no fields are set for a layer, none of the fields in the layer will be trusted.

        // NOTE: Features owned by the logged in user are always visible.
