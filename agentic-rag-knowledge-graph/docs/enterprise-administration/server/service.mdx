## Description

The resource for an individual service returns the properties and service definition comprosing a GIS service. A service exposes GIS resources like maps, rasters, locators, and geodatabases through REST and SOAP interfaces. The type of the service is often dictated by the type of resource being published. In addition to accessing the underlying resource, a GIS service can expose additional capabilities called extensions (or server object extensions). [ Extensions](/extensiontypes) are packages of custom functionality that can perform business logic or expose the service through additional formats or protocols.

When a service is [started](/startservice), it is ready to service requests from users. A service typically has one or more instances (objects) defined by the `minInstancesPerNode` and `maxInstancesPerNode` propeties in the service definition. The `maxIdleTime` parameter defines how long these objects are kept alive when not in use.

The [status](/status) resource on the service describes the current state of the service. To get detailed information about the instances in your service, you can access the [statistics](/servicestatistics) resource.
