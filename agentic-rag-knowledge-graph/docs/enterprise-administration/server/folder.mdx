## Description

The resource for an individual folder returns the folder's properties, including its description and the services it contains. ArcGIS Server supports a single level hierarchy of folders. By grouping services within a folder, you can conveniently set permissions on them as a single unit. A folder inherits the permissions of the root folder when it is created, but you can change those permissions at a later time.
