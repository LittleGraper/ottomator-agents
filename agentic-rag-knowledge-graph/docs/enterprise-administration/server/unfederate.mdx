## Description

The `unfederate` operation removes any Enterprise portal items that represent services running on the federated server that you will be unfederating. These services are removed automatically as part of the unfederate process. However, if the automatic removal of service items fails as part of the unfederate process, you can manually re-run this operation to remove the items from the portal.

<Note type={"caution"}>

Unfederating a server site has several significant consequences and should not be done as part of routine troubleshooting. It is an act that is not easily undone and may have irreversible consequences. Only unfederate a site if you have a clear understanding of the impact. See [Administer a federated server](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/administer-a-federated-server.htm) for more details.

</Note>

The `unfederate` operation does not remove any items representing services published by portal users (in other words, services on the server located in the **Hosted** folder). Those services are entirely managed by the Enterprise portal.
