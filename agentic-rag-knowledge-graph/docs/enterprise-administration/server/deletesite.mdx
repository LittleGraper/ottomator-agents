## Description 

<Note type={"note"}>

This operation is available only when a server machine is participating in a site and can be invoked from any server machine in the site. 

</Note>

The `deleteSite` operation deletes the site configuration and releases all server resources. The `deleteSite` operation should be performed on development or test servers that need to be cleaned reguarly. 

This is an unrecoverable operation. Use caution with this option because it deletes all services, settings, and other configurations.

This operation performs the following tasks:

- Stops all server machines participating in the site. This in turn stops all GIS services hosted on the server machines.
- All services and cluster configurations are deleted. 

    <Note type={"note"}>

    Clusters have been deprecated. The use of clusters for new deployments is strongly discouraged and existing deployments are advised to migrate away from use of clusters as part of ongoing maintenance and upgrades.

    </Note>
- All server machines are unregistered from the site.
- All server machines are unregistered from the site.
- The configuration store is deleted.
