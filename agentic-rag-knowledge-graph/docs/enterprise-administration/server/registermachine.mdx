## Description

The `register` operation registers a server machine with the site. The server machine must have ArcGIS Server installed and authorized. Registering machines this way is a pull approach to growing the site and allows you to add a large number of machines to a site. In contrast, you can [join](/joinsite) a server machine to a site.

<Note type={"note"}>

If you are adding more than one machine to a site, the [server directories](/directories) and [configuration store](/configstore) must be directories on a shared file system.

</Note>

If the site has registered [Relational Data Store Types](/relational-data-store-types) and more machines are added, you must completely restart ArcGIS Server on each newly registered machine. To do this, restart the Windows service or use the `stopserver`/`startserver` scripts on Linux.

<Note type={"note"}>

At 10.9.1, when installing ArcGIS Server you had the option to disable the ArcMap service runtime. Attempting to register a server machine that had a conflicting ArcMap runtime status to the site would result in an error. Starting at ArcGIS Enterprise 11.0, the optional ArcMap Runtime Support feature is removed, and an existing site and any new machines being registered no longer have the potential to be in conflict.

</Note>
