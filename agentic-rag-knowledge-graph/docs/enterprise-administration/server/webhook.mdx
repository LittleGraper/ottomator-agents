## Description

The resource for an individual webhook returns the configuration information for either a geoprocessing service or a feature service webhook. From this resource, administrators can edit the webhook's configuration, or delete the individual webhook rather than deleting all webhooks for a geoprocessing or feature service.

<Note type={"note"}>

ArcGIS Enterprise supports organization, feature service, and geoprocessing webhooks. The ArcGIS Portal Directory allows for the creation and management of organization webhooks, whereas the ArcGIS Server Administrative API Directory supports the creation and management of geoprocessing and feature service webhooks. For more information on organization webhooks in ArcGIS Enterprise, see either the ArcGIS Portal Directory API [webhook documentation](DEVSITE/rest/users-groups-and-items/create-webhooks.htm) or the [Manage webhooks in ArcGIS Enterprise](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/create-webhooks.htm) administrative documentation. ArcGIS Online also supports feature service webhooks, which are managed in the ArcGIS Online Administrative Services Directory. To learn more about ArcGIS Online feature service webhooks, see the [Web Hooks](DEVSITE/rest/services-reference/online/web-hooks-feature-service-.htm) API documentation.
