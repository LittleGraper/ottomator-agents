## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

The `joinSite` operation is available only when a server machine is not already participating in any site.

</Note>

The `joinSite` operation connects a server machine to an existing site. This is considered a push mechanism, in which a server machine pushes its configuration to the site. For the operation to be successful, you must provide an account with administrative privileges to the site.

When an attempt is made to join a site, the site validates the administrative credentials, and returns connection information about its [configuration store](/configstore) back to the server machine. The server machine then uses the connection information to work with the configuration store. If this is the first server machine in your site, use the [`Create Site`](/createsite) operation instead.

If your site has registered [Relational Data Store Types](/relational-data-store-types), you must completely restart ArcGIS Server on the newly joined machines. To do this, restart the Windows Service or use the `stopserver`/`startserver` scripts on Linux.

<Note type={"note"}>

At 10.9.1, when installing ArcGIS Server you had the option to disable the ArcMap service runtime. Attempting to join a server machine to an existing site that had a conflicting ArcMap runtime status would result in an error. Starting at ArcGIS Enterprise 11.0, the optional ArcMap Runtime Support feature is removed, and an existing site and joining server machines no longer have the potential to be in conflict.

</Note>
