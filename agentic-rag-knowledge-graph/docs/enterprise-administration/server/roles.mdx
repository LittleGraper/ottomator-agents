## Description

The `roles` resource represents all roles available in the [role store](/rolestore). The ArcGIS Server security model supports a role-based access control in which each role can be assigned certain permissions (privileges) to access one or more resources. Users are assigned to these roles. The server then authorizes each requesting user based on all the roles assigned to the user. 

As the role space could be potentially large, you can use the paged [Get Roles](/getroles) operation to iterate through the list of roles, or you can use the [Search Roles](/searchroles) operation to search for a specific role.

ArcGIS Server is capable of connecting to your enterprise identity stores such as Active Directory or other directory services exposed via the LDAP protocol. Such identity stores are treated as read-only stores and ArcGIS Server does not attempt to update them. As a result, operations that need to update the role store (such as adding roles, removing roles, updating roles) are not supported when the role store is read-only. On the other hand, you can configure your ArcGIS Server to use the default role store shipped with the server, which is treated as a read-write store. 

The total numbers of roles are returned in the response.
