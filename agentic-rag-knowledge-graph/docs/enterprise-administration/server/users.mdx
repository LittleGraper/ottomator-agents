## Description

The `users` resource represents all users available in the [user store](/userstore) that can administer ArcGIS Server and access the GIS services hosted on the server. In short, it represents the complete user space. As the user space could be potentially large, there isn't any listing of users, but you can use [Get Users](/getusers) or [Search](/searchusers) operations to access their account information. 

ArcGIS Server is capable of connecting to your enterprise identity stores such as Active Directory or other directory services exposed through the LDAP protocol. Such identity stores are treated as read only, and ArcGIS Server does not attempt to update them. As a result, operations that need to update the identity store (such as adding users, removing users, updating users, assigning roles and removing assigned roles) are not supported when identity stores are read only. On the other hand, you could configure your ArcGIS Server to use the default identity store (shipped with the server) which is treated as a read-write store. The total numbers of users are returned in the response.
