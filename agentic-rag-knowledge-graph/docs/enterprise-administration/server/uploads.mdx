## Description

The `uploads` resource is a collection of all the items that have been uploaded to the server. There are two ways to upload items. You can upload complete items using the [Upload Item](/uploaditem) operation. If a particular item is made up of many chunks ([parts](/itemparts)), you need to first [register](/registeritem) the item and subsequently upload the individual parts using the [ Upload Part](/uploadpart) operation. 

Item uploads are filtered by an allowed list of filename extensions. Below is the default list:

- `soe` 
- `sd` 
- `sde` 
- `odc` 
- `csv` 
- `txt` 
- `zshp` 
- `kmz` 

The default list can be overridden by setting the `uploadFileExtensionAllowedList` property with the [ server properties API](/serverproperties).

<Note type={"note"}>

At 10.9, the name of this parameter has been updated from `uploadFileExtensionWhitelist`  to `uploadFileExtensionAllowedList` .
