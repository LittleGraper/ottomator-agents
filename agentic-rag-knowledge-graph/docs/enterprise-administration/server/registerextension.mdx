## Description

<Note type={"note"}>

At 10.9.1, when installing ArcGIS Server, you had the option to disable the ArcMap service runtime. When the ArcMap runtime was disabled, you could not register server object extensions (SOEs) that were created with the ArcObjects SDK.

</Note>

The `register` operation registers the SOEs defined in the .soe file. A .soe file is a container of one or more server object extensions. 

Before you perform this operation, the .soe file needs to be [uploaded](/uploaditem) it to the server. The `itemID` returned after uploading the file is used as the value for the `id` parameter.

<Note type={"tip"}>

When registering a new .soe file, ensure that none of the extensions in the .soe file have already been registered, as this operation will not update the preexisting server object extension. Use the [Update](/updateextension) operation if you need to update any preexisting server objects extensions.

</Note>

Starting with ArcGIS Enterprise 11.0, ArcObjects extensions and 10.x versions of Enterprise SDK extensions are no longer supported. Attempting to register or enable these extensions will fail with an error message. Only version 11.x extensions can be registered.
