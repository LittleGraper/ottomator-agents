## Description

The `permissions` resource models the permissions on the given folder or service. Permissions are access privileges that are assigned to roles (principals) by the service administrator to provide a role-based access control. 

ArcGIS Server implements the [Continuous Inheritance Model](/continuousinheritancemodel), under which a resource (such as a folder or service) inherits the permissions of its parent resource during creation, but these permissions can be changed at a later time.

Permissions are assigned to roles using the [Add Permission ](/addpermission) operation. To purge all the permissions that have been assigned to a role, you can use the [Clean Permissions](/cleanpermissions) operation. This operation is useful if the role is to be deleted from the role store.
