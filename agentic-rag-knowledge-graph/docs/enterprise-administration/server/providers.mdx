## Description

The `providers` resource returns the supported provider types for the GIS services in your organization. Starting at ArcGIS Enterprise 10.9.1, this resource includes an enabled providers section that specifies which of the supported providers are currently enabled. At Enterprise 11.0, only `ArcObjects11` is supported as an enabled provider.

<Note type={"note"}>

At 10.9.1, when installing ArcGIS Server you had the option to disable the ArcMap service runtime. If you chose not to disable the ArcMap service runtime, the `providers` resource returned both `ArcObjects` and `ArcObjects11` as enabled providers.

</Note>
