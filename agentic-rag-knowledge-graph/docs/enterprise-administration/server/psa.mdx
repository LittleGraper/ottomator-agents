## Description

The `psa` resource provides access to operations that configure the credentials and the login privileges of the primary site administrator account. This account is stored within server and can be used to log into the server and perform administrative workflows. Use the [Update](/updatepsa) operation to change the name and the password for the account. However, if you don't want to use this default administrative account (and prevent anybody from using it to log into Manager), you can use the [Disable](/disablepsa) operation to disable the login capabilities of the account. The JSON response for this resource returns if this account has been disabled or not.
