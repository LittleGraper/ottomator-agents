## Description

The `statistics` resource provides a view into the life cycle of all instances of the service on all server machines in the site.

Initially, all instances are in the `notCreated` state, but they move into the `initializing` state as they are constructed. The instances are not usable in any of these states. A fully constructed instance remains in the pool (in other words, the free state) before it's called into service. Instances are marked as `busy`  when they're servicing requests. Once request processing is complete, instances are returned to the pool; they are free to service any other requests.

The `transactions` metric indicates the total number of invocations that have occurred on the service. Similarly, `totalBusyTime` indicates the total amount of time the service is in use servicing requests.

You can view the statistics for a machine or use the `summary` property, which consolidates the metrics from all server machines into one for the entire site.

<Note type={"note"}>

Sometimes a service is not deployed on a server machine (if the machine could not be reached when the service was started), or the server machine may be stopped. In this case, the `isStatisticsAvailable` flag is set to `false`.
