## Description

The `webhooks` resource returns a list of service webhooks configured for a specific geoprocessing or feature service, including deactivated and activated webhooks. In ArcGIS Enterprise, webhooks provide other applications and webhook receivers with event-driven information, delivered as an HTTPS POST request, that can be used to create automated and integrative workflows. For more information about how webhooks are supported in ArcGIS Enterprise, see [Webhooks in ArcGIS Enterprise](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/about-arcgis-webhooks.htm).

<Note type={"note"}>

ArcGIS Enterprise supports organization, feature service, and geoprocessing webhooks. The ArcGIS Portal Directory allows for the creation and management of organization webhooks, whereas the ArcGIS Server Administrative API Directory supports the creation and management of geoprocessing and feature service webhooks. For more information on organization webhooks in ArcGIS Enterprise, see either the ArcGIS Portal Directory API [webhook documentation](DEVSITE/rest/users-groups-and-items/create-webhooks.htm) or the [Manage webhooks in ArcGIS Enterprise](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/create-webhooks.htm) administrative documentation. ArcGIS Online also supports feature service webhooks, which are managed in the ArcGIS Online Administrative Services Directory.
