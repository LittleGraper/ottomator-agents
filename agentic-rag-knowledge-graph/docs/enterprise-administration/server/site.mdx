## Description

When ArcGIS Server is installed on a server machine, you must [create a new site](/createsite). A site is a collection of server resources, such as server machines that have ArcGIS Server installed with GIS services, data, and so on.

Subsequently, newer server machines can [join](/joinsite) a site and increase its computing power. Once a site is no longer required, it can be [deleted](/deletesite), which releases its resources.

<Note type={"note"}>

The configuration and meta information for the site is maintained on disk in a set of files that comprise the [configuration store](/configstore).

</Note>

Once a site has been created, the result is a root resource for administering an ArcGIS Server deployment. The root resource returns a collection of hierarchically organized, top-level resources that provide access to additional resources and operations: [Machines](/machines), [Services](/services), [Security](/security), [System](/system), [Data](/data), [Uploads](/uploads), [Logs](/logs), [KML](/kml), [Info](/info), [Mode](/mode), and [Usage Reports](/usagereports).

Alternative views of the root resource page, such as the `json` and `pjson` response formats, return the site's current licensing and language information.
