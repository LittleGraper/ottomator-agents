## Description

The resource for an individual machine returns the information for a server machine and provides access to various operations that can be used to manage the server machine. A server machine represents a machine on which ArcGIS Server software has been installed and licensed. A site is composed of one or more server machines that work together to host GIS services and data and provide administrative capabilities for the site. Each server machine is capable of performing all these tasks, and a site can be thought of as a distributed peer-to-peer network of such machines. 

A server machine communicates with its peers over a range of TCP and UDP ports that can be configured using the [Edit](/editmachine) operation. [Starting](/startmachine) and stopping the server machine enables and disables, respectively, its ability to host GIS services.

The administrative capabilities of the server machine are available through the ArcGIS Server Administrator Directory that can be accessed over HTTP or HTTPS. For a server machine to participate in a site, it must be [registered](/registermachine) with the site. A machine can participate in only one site at a time. To remove a machine permanently from a site, you can use the [Unregister`](/unregistermachine) operation.
